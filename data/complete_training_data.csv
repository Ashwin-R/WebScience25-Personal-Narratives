"It is exactly what happened.     A user had a 12 hour ban, and asked why when he'd only said \*this\*.   It was on a thread after the J.K Rowling thing had happened, where she'd said the thing about uterus'   They then uploaded an image of a tweet where they'd used a word. I'm obviously avoiding the use of it here in case it happens again.   They seemed to be using English in a second language sense. The tweets were slightly broken.  A few people replied saying basically, 'well buddy.. You used a no no word there'. To which they replied? 'What word?!'.  I replied saying \*this\* word. I put the word in quotation marks.   It means \*this\* here is a slang dictionary link explaining what that means and why it might have caused someone to report you.     I then got permanently banned, with them using that tweet as reason. I appealed it 4 times, but there didn't seem to be any way to actually talk to a living human being.   Varying amounts of time would go by, at which point they'd send me the reason as to why I wasn't going to be un-banned, was because of hate speech.     After about 8 months I just gave up.   In hindsight, I do actually wonder if it wasn't some kind of trick to get people to speak on a specific matter, only to then report them. It was obviously on a pretty heated subject matter at the time, though I didn't speak on that specifically at all.     The rest of my account was boring as hell.. It was mostly about motorcycle racing and I didn't really even use it much.   I even joined a subreddit for a while based on weird twitter bans, but no one on there ever had any luck reversing a decision like that after the fact.   A lot of them were financial based accounts, accused of spamming, etc, but they seemed to be under the belief that there was a large degree of automated account removal, and it was near impossible to get off of a list once on it, or to be seen by an actual human because of the sheer scale of the accounts on twitter.

"You mistake my understanding of why and how Trump happened with personal discontent under the Obama administration, but Ill answer you anyway even though I voted third party in 2016 and abstained in 2020.  One of my earliest memories is 9/11. I visited Washington, D.C. in 8th grade as a school trip, and was there when Bin Laden was killed. My entire life Ive known the United States to be at war. When a President campaigns on ending those wars and yet I graduate high school to see friends enlisting, knowing they might end up in the Middle East, I do feel a bit betrayed.   When his administration goes after Snowden and expands the NSA and the Patriot Act, I feel wronged by my government.   With slow growth post-recession, my single income household struggled. My father worked in construction and had less than a high school education. There wasnt work for him after 2008. I didnt get to have my own car at 16. None of that is directly Obamas fault per se, but my financial/economic situation heading into college was bleak.  As for race relations personally affecting me, well, how doesnt it? Increasing racial tensions and misreporting the facts on individual cases in favor of sensationalism hurts everyone, everywhere. It discourages people from becoming police, it makes conversation on serious topics harder, etc.   Partisanship in the Senate obviously impacts me. Increasing partisanship spreads to other issues, and when the result ends up being *more* power in the federal governments hands, Im less powerful over my own life when I vote in local elections at the state level and more bound by the wants of people that may live LITERALLY thousands of miles away in vastly different situations.

"&gt; When the insurrection failed, Bannon continued his campaign for his former boss by other means. On his War Room podcast, which has tens of millions of downloads, Bannon said President Trump lost because the Republican Party sold him out. This is your call to action, Bannon said in February, a few weeks after Trump had pardoned him of federal fraud charges  &gt; The solution, Bannon announced, was to seize control of the GOP from the bottom up. Listeners should flood into the lowest rung of the party structure: the precincts. Its going to be a fight, but this is a fight that must be won, we dont have an option, Bannon said on his show in May. Were going to take this back village by village  precinct by precinct.  &gt; Precinct officers are the worker bees of political parties, typically responsible for routine tasks like making phone calls or knocking on doors. But collectively, they can influence how elections are run. In some states, they have a say in choosing poll workers, and in others they help pick members of boards that oversee elections.  &gt; After Bannons endorsement, the precinct strategy rocketed across far-right media. Viral posts promoting the plan racked up millions of views on pro-Trump websites, talk radio, fringe social networks and message boards, and programs aligned with the QAnon conspiracy theory.  &gt; Suddenly, people who had never before showed interest in party politics started calling the local GOP headquarters or crowding into county conventions, eager to enlist as precinct officers. They showed up in states Trump won and in states he lost, in deep-red rural areas, in swing-voting suburbs and in populous cities.  ...  &gt; **ProPublica contacted GOP leaders in 65 key counties, and 41 reported an unusual increase in signups since Bannons campaign began. At least 8,500 new Republican precinct officers (or equivalent lowest-level officials) joined those county parties. We also looked at equivalent Democratic posts and found no similar surge.**  &gt; Ive never seen anything like this, people are coming out of the woodwork, said J.C. Martin, the GOP chairman in Polk County, Florida, who has added 50 new committee members since January. Martin had wanted congressional Republicans to overturn the election on Jan. 6, and he welcomed this wave of like-minded newcomers. The most recent time we saw this type of thing was the tea party, and this is way beyond it.  ...  &gt; Presidential losses often energize party activists, and it would not be the first time that a candidates faction tried to consolidate control over the party apparatus with the aim of winning the next election.  &gt; Whats different this time is an uncompromising focus on elections themselves. The new movement is built entirely around Trumps insistence that the electoral system failed in 2020 and that Republicans cant let it happen again. The result is a nationwide groundswell of party activists whose central goal is not merely to win elections but to reshape their machinery.  &gt; They feel President Trump was rightfully elected president and it was taken from him, said Michael Barnett, the GOP chairman in Palm Beach County, Florida, who has enthusiastically added 90 executive committee members this year. They feel their involvement in upcoming elections will prevent something like that from happening again.  ...  &gt; Bannon plucked the precinct strategy out of obscurity. For more than a decade, a little-known Arizona tea party activist named Daniel J. Schultz has been preaching the plan. Schultz failed to gain traction, despite winning a $5,000 prize from conservative direct-mail pioneer Richard Viguerie in 2013 and making a 2015 pitch on Bannons far-right website, Breitbart. Schultz did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  &gt; **In December, Schultz appeared on Bannons podcast to argue that Republican-controlled state legislatures should nullify the election results and throw their states Electoral College votes to Trump. If lawmakers failed to do that, Bannon asked, would it be the end of the Republican Party? Not if Trump supporters took over the party by seizing precinct posts, Schultz answered,** beginning to explain his plan. Bannon cut him off, offering to return to the idea another time.  &gt; That time came in February. Schultz returned to Bannons podcast, immediately preceding Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO who spouts baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.  &gt; **We can take over the party if we invade it,** Schultz said. I cant guarantee you that well save the republic, but I can guarantee you this: Well lose it if we conservatives dont take over the Republican Party.  ...  &gt; **Schultzs strategy also got a boost from another prominent QAnon promoter: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who urged Trump to impose martial law and rerun the election. On a May online talk show, Flynn told listeners to fill thousands of positions that are vacant at the local level.**  &gt; **Precinct recruitment is now the forefront of our mission for Turning Point Action, according to the right-wing organizations website.**  ...  &gt; **Organizers from around the country started huddling with Schultz for weekly Zoom meetings. The meetings host, far-right blogger Jim Condit Jr. of Cincinnati, kicked off a July call by describing the precinct strategy as the last alternative to violence.** Its the only idea, Condit said, unless you want to pick up guns like the Founding Fathers did in 1776 and start to try to take back our country by the Second Amendment, which none of us want to do.  &gt; **By the next week, though, Schultz suggested the new precinct officials might not stay peaceful.** Schultz belonged to a mailing list for a group of military, law enforcement and intelligence veterans called the 1st Amendment Praetorian that organizes security for Flynn and other pro-Trump figures. Back in the 1990s, Schultz wrote an article defending armed anti-government militias like those involved in that decades deadly clashes with federal agents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas.  &gt; **Make sure everybodys got a baseball bat, Schultz said on the July strategy conference call, which was posted on YouTube. Im serious about this. Make sure youve got people who are armed.**  And it just keeps going. This article is long, excellent, and absolutely balls to the wall batshit crazy.

"&gt;I just want us to have the conversation, by us I don't mean you and I but everybody,  Which the Liberals could have done but didn't.  You can go back and read up on what happened.  For example, you can find a McGill University that covers it briefly and highlights a book that covers it [here]( https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2017/05/why-trudeau-abandoned-electoral-reform/) As promised, Trudeau put together a commission to recommend a replacement to replace FPTP. The problem was he got flak because the commission was composed of *only* Liberals, so he added a couple Conservatives and NDP (with the majority of the commission still Liberal).  This was fine. It moved ahead and looked at FPTP (benefits the Conservatives), ranked ballot (benefits the Liberals) and Proportional (benefits the NDP). You can find one of their reports on their findings [here]( https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/erre/report-3/page-174).  The majority of the commission was for ranked ballot (because the majority of the commission were Liberals).  When they queried the public though, the Canadians who responded were in favour of Proportional, which would have cost the Liberal seats.  So, how do you push through a new electoral system that'd balloon your party's seats when your own commission says the country wants a different system?  Do you proceed with a referendum asking the country what system they want? Of course not. You kill the whole discussion instead because while FPTP doesn't guarantee the Liberals power like ranked ballot, it's still easier for them to remain in power than proportional.",tensor(0)

"One interesting thing I found about the Vietnam war is the very limited bombing of north Vietnam which goes contrary to the stereotype of indiscriminate bombing people usually think of about Vietnam:  &gt;When Karnow first visited Hanoi, expecting to find extensive damage from supposed ""carpet bombing"" in the 1972 ""Christmas bombing raids,"" he instead found a city ""almost completely unscathed."" This misrepresentation had not been unintentional: ""American anti-war activists visiting the city during the attacks urged the mayor to claim a death toll of 10,000. He refused, saying that his government's credibility was at stake. The official North Vietnamese figure for fatalities . . . was 1,318 in Hanoi."" The charge of ""carpet bombing"" was ludicrous, for in a real carpet bombing campaign such as the American incendiary bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 ""nearly 84,000 people were killed in a single night.""  https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1983/10/02/vietnam-the-war-of-broken-dreams/9b6af194-0973-492d-af49-afb058237f0e/   &gt; The CIA estimated that the operation inflicted $500 million in damage on the North. The agency estimated that by April 1967, 52,000 casualties, including 21,000 deaths, had occurred in the air raids. An estimated 75 percent of casualties were involved in military or quasi-military operations. U.S. government estimates put the number of civilian deaths stemming from the operation at 30,000.  https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/lbj-operation-rolling-thunder-feb-13-1965-1162618  Im not sure how accurate these CIA estimates are but if theyre from a declassified document theres little reason for them to have artificially reduced their estimates since they werent going to be published.

"That notion bit one guy in the butt, bigtime. He and his older brother (both young men in their early 20s)  were living in San Francisco in the late 1970s/early 1980s. His brother contracted HIV and died  of AIDS  in 1982, at an obscenely early age. Then the surviving brother was diagnosed as HIV positive. He responded by using his brother's credit cards and going on a shopping frenzy, because he knew he was going to be dead in a  matter of months. And he didn't steal just his brother's identity ; he used fake credentials to live a millionaire's lifestyle, because he wanted a little joy before his inevitable death (and he was grieving his brother, with whom he'd been close, too). And everyone knew an HIV diagnosis means death in a  matter of months or at most a year or two, so there was nothing to lose.  In 2015 the FBI finally caught up with him, and sent him (still HIV positive, but not sick) to prison for a few years.  Yeah.  And that man had a lot more reason for his reaction to an HIV positive diagnosis than people who are panicking over a covid-positive test or possible exposure. The CDC has told us that even an elderly diabetic obese person has a 95% chance of survival ; for the rest of us, a 99.8%. So why the panic-? I mean, I know WHY ; it's because the media is happily conflating 'positive tests' with 'actually ill' and 'ill' with 'guaranteed to die', ignoring the high rate of  false positives, and obfuscating 'died FROM covid' with 'died WITH covid, a positive test up to 28 days earlier/actual cause of death anything from car accident to heart attack to suicide' but why doesn't this freely shared CDC knowledge not calm fears?

"Thanksgiving 1998, I was bailing on my lease for a room in a party house which was no party for me.  Two Menominee brothers from the scene, but not housemates, were chilling there.  I had forgotten about the holiday, all my family was a thousand miles away.  Somehow it came up in conversation that they were Menominee, which I hadn't known.  I told them about how, in the NA studies class I took earlier that year, they said the Menominee managed to keep the land that became their reservation, when so many other nations had less success versus colonization, etc.  A little later, housemate DJ Coke Fiend arrived, and enthusiastically offered us turkey dinner (I guess he had been putting it together earlier).  We all declined in our own ways, and just smoked and spoke about more interesting things among the three of us.  I don't think the brothers stuck around for the party that night. I went to the bar alone, came back home alone later, of course everyone there was still wide awake...  I guess my point to all this is, there's neighbors we have in our USA with us, we can be polite to these friends and neighbors, by keeping low key about this particular holiday, when in their company.  I feel like I grew in some way from that episode way back then. Like I experienced a perspective, which I hadn't ever by the usual holiday meal with my family.",tensor(1)

And instead of coming up with a platform that returned to traditional conservative values (although I disagree with 99% of them), they ran into the arms of Trump, and turned to cult-of-personality, and had nothing to offer America. Even their 2020 party platform was essentially a 1-sheet doc saying ""whatever daddy trump wants, we want"".   I first voted in 2004, and although it was for Kerry I was open to republicans politicians. I'd give them a chance, hear them out, see what they stood for. Not anymore.

"I am not an expert on these things. In my opinion, structural racism refers to laws, regulations, and problems that exist because of where a person is born (food deserts, lack of healthcare infrastructure, failing schools, etc.) that affect people differently based on their race.   Institutional racism would be policies, procedures, and persistent cultures that exist in groups who are in power that foster a negative perception of ""others"" and result in different outcomes because of it.   I remember hearing an interview with doctor who did his emergency residency in an urban hospital in Atlanta in the 1980s. If a white woman came in complaining of pelvic pain, he was told that the primary differential diagnosis should be endometriosis. If a woman of color came in complaining of the same thing, he was told that the primary differential diagnosis should be a sexually transmitted infection. That is an example of institutional racism. Doctors were trained to treat people differently simply because of the color of their skin. This is something that happened in my lifetime. This was from a doctor who is still practicing medicine to this day. We are not talking about the 1800s when enslaved Black women were treated like medical experiments and had surgeries performed on them without anesthesia and without regard for life-altering complications. Structural racism would be a women of color being unable to access primary care because there were no doctors available in her area.   (Sorry if I'm not explaining myself well. I'm still on my first cup of coffee.)",tensor(0)

I don't need experience, though fortunately I have it. The crowd wasn't bad and was mainly focused on the abusive policing, which if the murderer had been paying as much attention to, both issues would have likely been solved. The restraint used was unnecessary, not confined by the state, and directly led to the death of someone in the cops care.

"***University Of California Fires Ethics Program Director For Refusing COVID Vax***  https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/rnupo9/university_of_california_fires_ethics_program/  &gt;""Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, the longtime professor of psychiatry at the University of CaliforniaIrvine School of Medicine who sued the university over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate because it made no exceptions for natural immunity, has been fired by the institution for refusing the vaccine.  &gt;In a blog post titled Farewell, University of California, Dr. Kheriaty said he received notice of what he called his arbitrary and capricious firing on Dec. 16. It was effective the same day. The termination ends his UCI medical teaching career and his longtime role as director of the Medical Ethics Program at UCI Health.  &gt;Kheriaty said he worked unpaid nights helping the UCI presidents office draft triage guidelines for scarce resources and vaccines during the pandemic. When N-95 masks were so scarce that hospitals kept them under lock and key, Kheriaty said he found a supply at a local construction company and provided them to doctors and nurses.  &gt;Everyone at the university seemed to be a fan of my work, until suddenly they were not, Kheriaty wrote. Once I challenged one of their policies, I immediately became a threat to the health and safety of the community.  &gt;No amount of empirical evidence about natural immunity or vaccine safety and efficacy mattered at all.  &gt;The Universitys leadership was not interested in scientific debate or ethical deliberation. When I was placed on unpaid suspension, I was not permitted to use my paid time offthat is to say, I was ordered to stay off campus because I was not vaccinated, but I also could not take vacation at home because I was not vaccinated.  &gt;Kheriaty said the university tried to prevent him from doing any professional work while he was on unpaid suspension, in an effort to pressure him to resign from a job he had held for 15 years. He said he wasnt allowed on campus except to move out of his office. Kheriaty was also restricted from making money off-campus. It was dizzying and, at times, surreal, he wrote.  &gt;The firing decision, he said, was not made by the psychiatry department but by the UCI presidents office. Asked by The Epoch Times for more information about Dr. Kheriatys firing, UCI spokesman Tom Vasich wrote, UCI does not comment on personnel issues. Kheriaty was on unpaid suspension after initially being placed on investigatory leave.  &gt;Now its officially over, Kheriaty wrote on his blog. I do not regret my time at the university. Indeed, I will miss my colleagues, the residents, and the medical students. I will miss teaching and supervising and doing ethics consults on some of the most challenging cases in the hospital.  &gt;Kheriaty sued the University of California Board of Regents in federal court on Aug. 18, alleging the universitys vaccine mandate violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, Kheriaty contracted COVID-19, so he now has natural immunity, which he argues is likely superior to protection from a vaccine.  &gt;His lawsuit is working its way through U.S. District Court.  &amp;nbsp;  Comment:  &gt;This is all about research money. If these institutions allow for dissent, they will stop getting grant money. There are no exceptions. Just happened at university of Florida a couple weeks ago where they either didn't release a study or changed the results bc they were worried about funding going away.",tensor(0)

Some Republican will run not to win, but to raise their profile for other elections and take up more of a leadership role in local Republican politics.""  A similar situation happened when AOC was running for re-election: First she was unsuccessfully primary'd by a centrist ""Democrat"". That one was actually worth attempting because while she won handily it wasn't clear if her initial primary win was a fluke. The R who ran against her in the general wanted to raise his profile because of how high her profile is, and because it'd be embarrassing for the Republicans to say they didn't oppose her seat.

Most of them agreed with him on the anti-SJW culture wars stuff and liked it when he was talking about someone getting into a shouting match on a college campus or other internet celebrities getting into Twitter drama or whatever.  They tended to be less interested in the stuff that was directly related to American policy (i.e., when he talks about stuff American politicians had done recently), except in a more general sense when the policy stuff had made it on the news here in Australia.

"In addition to the points already noted, venture capitalists are snatching up doctor's office and using them as profit machines. Their sole objective is to extract as much profit as possible--usually to the detriment of patients.  Also, doctors and hospitals are intentionally overcharging patients to make up for shortfalls from lower insurance payments. Here's an example I just experienced. I took my kid for a well visit, which insurance covers. There was a mix-up and insurance rejected the claim, so the doctor's office sent me a bill. That bill was over $1,000 for a routine well visit: weight, height, are you eating vegetables? When I called the office to ask what I was being charged for, they said that the insurance companies pays so little that they have to inflate costs. The insurance co ends up paying $75 for that well visit. But as a patient, I would have been on the hook for $1,000.",tensor(1)
"But that's the thing everyone is failing to realize because they're gripped with hysteria.  If you wear an N95 mask, no one has to do shit.    I work in massive crowds everyday all throughout the pandemic and I never once even got a cold because no surprise, I used an N95 mask, I kept a distance, I washed and used hand sanitizer regularly, and I never touched my face.  I used sensible judgment in a time when none of us regular people even to this day, can accurately assess the risk of any of this or the solutions we have available.  So I've stopped trying to make demands about masks or the vaccines and instead, decided to just focus on what I believe to be the safest way through this and so far it's working out pretty well.  Been a year and a half and zero illnesses and the only really shitty thing about  this is not going to bars or concerts or whatever.  But I still hang out with friends and still do my thing and its great because now I don't have to anger a bunch of people or get huffy when they don't listen to my suggestions.  Fuck it.  At the end of the day we're all in the dark on all of this even if we think we know what's going on so I just focus on what makes sense to me.  I think more people should think like this.  Herd immunity at 70 percent?  Maybe but we really don't know for sure so why destroy families and friends just to reach a goal that we don't exactly know if it will solve the problem, which for the vast majority in America is wearing a mask and not going out to crowded places.

"Made a list of his greatest hits in an another thread adding to it ifn when I find it. Yall playing at home feel free to add on  EDIT: some are asking for sources, down thread I have a list. One is disputed so Ill mark it as that.  - shut down commissions that were about to investigate him  - Shipped at-risk prisoners to a single facility upstate without testing anyone, exasperating the spread. When COVID first hit, he used prison slave labor to create hand sanitizer and then rolled back jail reform   - Refuses to vaccinate prisoners against CDC guidlelines, has commuted and pardoned less prisoners in 2020 than Trump. When investigative journalists looked into his solitary policy, they discovered extreme racial basis and he claimed to start taking care of a problem, and the next year the racial biases increased. *EDIT: it was racial bias in disciplinary practices, which includes solitary, link below* His parole board was all white up until recently and I believe is mostly all ex law enforcement   - convinced a small group of Democrats to caucus with Republicans so he could still have power. Horse traded a powerful third party to break up the caucus in exchange for their endorsement in a video known as the hostage video, only to take the endorsement and not follow through   - This past year, secretly funded republican opponents to prevent a Democrat supermajoirty in Albany (failed) *EDIT: I was basing this on a secondary source, lemme check to see if I got a primary source on this, if I cant get then Ill delete it.* **EDIT: it is smoking gun speculation, a Cuomo ally and Republican billionaire donor made last-minute donations to key races when there would not have been republican benefit. Sources that explain the situation with statements from all involved sides below**  - Tried to undermine a super popular, super powerful progressive third party in New York by inventing this fake ""feminist party"" to fool people into voting for them instead of the Working Families ticket.  - Buffalo Billion, which I never really understood but apparently involves graft and shit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Billion#Government_investigations  - withheld allocated funds for prison education/schools/pubilc housing/MTA. The courts ordered him to release COVID money meant to go to schools to provide food but he still refuses and yet gives money to his billionaire Trump-supporting donors. *edit: Im having trouble finding primary sources on this, just because its hard to Google. Im going to come back to it later*  - When he was told about an MTA crisis was about 6 years in the making, he took those MTA funds and gave them to snow resorts...  - We managed to secure this train expert (""train daddy"") to save our MTA, and Cuomo micromanaged him so much he scared him away...begged him to come back, which HE DID and then scared him away AGAIN  - Would get into endless piss fights with the NYC mayor and (although De Blasio sucks too) undermine our city and contradict De Blasio's decisions (The Gov has a shitload of control of NYC since the 70s)  - The one time that Cuomo and Deblaz set aside differences and worked together, it was to do the Amazon deal, which was this shitty lob-sided deal that gave $3 billion in subsidies, with NO community input and would had exasperated in the middle of a subway crisis one of the most over-extended lines. Also included a provision that liberalized helicopter clearance laws that was in place due to a long history in NYC of helicopter fatalities, and was put there because Bezos girlfriend was learning to fly a helicopter (*edit: trying to find a primary source on the gf thing, helipad source below, only have an article on them changing the laws and one on her being a helicopter pilot*)  - He dropped the n-word on a live mic and blamed NYTimes for it and NEVER got in serious trouble, which still surprises me to this day.  Called Obama a shuck and jive candidate  - Transferred his daughter's state trooper boyfriend to Niagara Falls because he hated him  - either him or his staffer allegedly (this has not been confirmed, which is why its towards the bottom) catfished the gay cousin/staffer of the Republican gubernatorial candidate and outed him to the papers. (The staffer has since recanted his cousin but also called out Cuomo for that)  - in the middle of a re-election renamed a major bridge from its original Lenape name to be after his dad as a form of promotion, to keep his name in the news. His brother repeatedly insisted he not do that and his dad would hate it  - Joseph Percoco, who Cuomo described as ""my father's third son"" found guilty for selling access to Cuomo to influence legislation in favor of energy industry. When the judge sentenced him to 6 years, she hinted that it should be a message to Cuomo.

Remember, the Bros' conspiracy originally stated that Pete and Amy and others were in the race to split the vote to hurt Bernie. In the hours after they dropped out they were celebrating.  It wasn't until the numbers starting coming in on Super Tuesday that the conspiracy took a total 180 saying they dropped out to hurt Bernie.  The thing with conspiracies is that they can be used to prove anything and anything can be used as evidence.  And that's why these people are not serious people.  Also remember that reddit had about 12 different VPs lined up due to Establishment Conspiracies, none of which were originally Kamala, but now the story has changed to include her of course.  And of all the moderates dropping out at once (all two of them) who were supposed to get cushy appointments in the administration for going along with it, only Pete ended up in the administration.  But don't let reality get in the way of a good conspiracy.  ""We'll find out on Tuesday if it's completely over or if Bernie has to keep fighting for another week or so!""

Much smaller protests abroad will gain more attention if it is in an oppressive regime like Russia.  I remember an acquaintance being very annoyed at the reporting of the police protesting pay cuts in 2012. 30,000 police officers protested (1/5 of the entire force) and 100,000 public sector workers. Not much was made of it. Tried to look at the front pages of the newspapers around the date and saw nothing.  Considering the police rarely protest and this was their biggest protest ever it should have gained more attention.  During protests, the police are seen as the enemy (some of their tactics are terrible). I think this shows that really the police are on the same side overall.

"Note: When I initially wrote this comment I was relying on my memory of more than fifty years of research that was all stolen by the Satanic Roman Catholic Church. In that comment I was trying to recall what I vaguely recall that Eustace Mullins said. As a result, I wrote that our Federal Government was lacking money to fight the Civil War because the Secretary of the Treasury, who was from the South intentionally put our Government in debt. However, because I no longer had my research documents or videos, I tried to rely on my vague memory, but my memory was not exactly accurate: It was the Secretary of the Treasury of the Confederate States who authorized the confiscation of Gold from the New Orleans Mint almost two months before the Civil War started that was a factor that led to the following events:   Lincoln, needing money to finance the Civil War, went with the United States Secretary of the Treasury to New York to apply for loans, but the bankers, wishing the Union to fail, offered loans at 24% to 36% which Lincoln declined to accept. Then an old friend of Lincoln's, Colonel Dick Taylor of Chicago, was put in charge of solving the problem of how to finance the war. He told Lincoln to get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes rather than money backed by gold and silver . . . or words to that extent.  Most large banks are influenced by the Rothschild banking family which supports the Vatican Jesuits who have ruled the Satanic Roman Catholic Church since 1814, and they all wanted the Union of the Republic Of the United States to fail, so they could proceed with their effort to rule a One World Government without interference from a powerful freedom loving United States Government.  Congress to authorize the printing of ""Greenbacks"" to finance the War which, although our Constitution authorizes our Treasury Dept to print money, you will have to read about the history of our banking and financial system to get the complete ""lowdown"" on way this was a ""big deal"". Some people, including Eustace Mullins believed that this combination of banking and religion was the primary reason President Abraham Lincoln was murdered.  Keep in mind that some people believe that circumventing the Federal Reserve Bank is the primary reason President John F. Kennedy was murdered. And since that date no one else has dared to circumvent the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.  Today our Federal Government is threatening to go to war against Russia, the main country in the world that supported our Federal Government during our Civil War, and our Federal Government today is planning to support Ukraine, which is the home country of many Communist who not only supported the Soviet Union, but worked with the Satanic Roman Catholic Church and Jewish leaders who've tried to destroy our Republican form of government and our ""freedom of the people, by the people, for the people"".  Of course Czar Alexander II, who helped to save our Federal Government, was subsequently murdered by the blood brothers of the people who worked with the Satanic Roman Catholic Church to destroy our Republic, and Putin now rules Russia, but things are not much different than they were in the years and days leading up to our Civil War. The difference is that, although Russia tried to befriend the United States after Russians ended the Soviet Union and took back control of their Nation, promoters of a New World Order, One World Totalitarian Government in the United States turned their backs on Russia. As a result, it seems that in order to survive the hostility of Jewish leaders, the Roman Catholic Church Hierarchy, Caste System Overlords and Communists, Russian rulers felt that they had no choice but to, presumably, go to the Vatican and Kowtow at the feet of the criminal, lying, thieving, poisoning, torturing, raping, murdering, Satanic Roman Catholic Church Hierarchy which pretends to be the friend of freedom, but is and has always been the purveyors of Satanic Evil.  ""It's deja vu all over again.""  Senator Manchin and the people of West Virginia know history. They know that many of their citizens are aware that their Great or Great Great grandparents loved freedom so much that they separated from the State of Virginia and fought and died for their freedom and the freedom of their fellow human beings. We must continue to resist the New World Order.   Final Note: I must make it clear that Christopher Gustavus Memminger who was Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederate States was born in Germany in 1803 but his father died one day after he was born and Christopher and his mother moved to Charleston, South Carolina where she died when Christopher was four years old. Christopher lived in an orphanage for seven years until he was eleven, at which time he was taken in by a lawyer and started college the next year when he was twelve years old. He graduated from college at sixteen years of age and became a lawyer. I sympathize with Christopher given his circumstances; nevertheless, he was the enemy.  Finally, the Confederate States of America began in February 1861 and the Civil War started almost two months later, in March 1861. Christopher Gustavus Memminger was appointed Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederate States, and three of the United States Mints with the most gold and or silver were located in the Confederate States. Christopher Gustavus Memminger confiscated the gold in the New Orleans Mint before the start of the Civil War. I don't know what happened to the gold in the other two U.S. Mints in the Confederate States; nevertheless, this made things difficult for the Union States.",tensor(0)

"She has asked if she needs to get the vaccine but there are still regulatory decisions needed to be made by the FDA. The FDA wants to track all participants for 2 years without disclosure to either group. The reason for this is to know if there are any common side effects.

" The World Anti Doping Association is in charge of creating and enforcing the rules concerning doping in sports. Every national and international sports federation subscribes to those rules. Its not something that any political leader can influence.   Each country has its own anti doping association that is charged with enforcement of WADA regulations.   The US has traditionally taken a strong stance in favor of strong anti-doping measures. This is important because other powerful countries (eg Russia) do not. If you are going to stand on principle, you have to be consistent, even when it negatively affects you.   We already suffered a black eye in the Houlihan case. She recently tested positive for a steroid, but because she was a potential gold medal winner, the USATF tried to let her run in the trials while her case was appealed. This was a direct violation of WADA rules and the USOC stepped in quickly and stopped it.   The rules are clear and so are the consequences. You cant stand in front of the international community and say this is a bad rule, so I shouldnt be punished. Thats a typical, self-indulgent American responsewhich thankfully Richardson had the class not to use.   Whether or not its a good rule or bad is a separate issue. Its only relevance is that, because of the circumstances, Richardsons reputation will remain intact or likely enhanced (as opposed to someone like Marion Jones).   The other thing is that a lot of this emotion is being stirred up because this was a potential gold medal winner. Im certain that had this happened to someone on the field hockey team, it would barely get a mention. I think people need to be honest with themselves about that.",tensor(0)

"I used to work at Mike Lindell's MyPillow factory. I saw the unspeakable things he did to get ahead in business and to this day I am in hiding.  https://ifapray.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike_Lindell.png At my first day at the mypillow factory, Mike Lindell gave me my production-line instructions himself. At the end he said 'ok this is the most vital part. It is the secret to the mypillow pillow's softness and sturdyness' and he proceeds to pull his pants down (he wasn't wearing any underwear) and hump the pillow 20 times before putting it back on the production line.  I was like 'sir, this is unethical'. Mike Lindell exploded 'ITS THE SECRET TO OUR PILLOWS STURDYNESS'. I said 'couldn't we fluff the pillow with our hands' and Mike Lindell said 'THE ARMS CAN'T APPLY ENOUGH PRESSURE, YOU NEED THE POWERFUL BUTTOCKS MUSCLES'.  I said 'sir, I just can't do it'. Mike Lindell said 'ok, how's that working out for you?'. I said 'huh'. Mike Lindell got more specific 'how much money do you make?'. I said '8.50 an hour' . Mike Lindell said 'I MAKE MORE MONEY IN A DAY THAN YOUR ENTIRE LINEAGE WILL EVER MAKE IN AN ENTIRE GENERATION'.  I was speechless.  Mike Lindell continued 'DO YOU WANT A BE A POOR FUCKING LOSER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, OR DO YOU WANT THE PATH FOR RESPECT, POWER, AND MONEY'.  I was still speechless, but Mike Lindell could see the shame in my face. He continued 'Imagine your life if you keep making 8.50 an hour for the rest of your life. What are the consequences of that? What will happen?'  Mike Lindell must of seen the fear of me having no future in my face because he pounced. He commanded 'HUMP THAT PILLOW OR GO BACK TO BEING A BETA MALE POOR LOSER'.  At this point, my feelings are hurt. I didn't want to be a loser anymore. I didn't want to be poor anymore. I humped that pillow. and I humped it again, and again, and again again, until I reached 20 humps.  My psyche was dissociative. Something died in me that day.  I humped pillows, and I out humped nearly every worker in that factory. I thought this would make Mike Lindell like me enough to promote me. I earned it. I did everything he said. How could he be wrong? He was a legit millionaire. He was the pinnacle of business success. I just needed to be patient and follow the principles of success.  But like a carrot on a stick, he kept dangling the promotion in front of me, only to take it away from me. He kept assigning me more and more pillows. Soon, I was putting in 80 hour weeks, and only getting paid for 40 of them. Soon, I wasn't even able to hump all the assigned pillows during the normal factory hours. I had to take pillows home and keep humping them after my fiance went to sleep.  One night she woke up and went to the kitchen to get some water, when she caught me pants-down, furiously humping a pillow to meet that weeks' deadline. We had a shouting match. The next day, there was an intervention, and with the help of my friends and family, they unbrainwashed me.  The next day, I told Mike I was quitting. Mike, pressed a button that locked the door behind me. Mike said 'NOBODY QUITS ON ME'. He then took his pants down and said 'ILL HUMP YA DO DEATH. THIS HIPS HAVE HUMPED MILLIONS OF PILLOWS, THEY WILL CRUSHED YOU'.  Somehow I did a backflip and reached the button, pressed it, and escaped with my life.  Me and my fiance have been living underground in fear of Mike Lindell's agents ever since.",tensor(1)

"MLK was one of the most important figures for the civil rights movement in America. As a non-white immigrant in this country, im a beneficiary of his lifes work. Why would I blame him for anything?   My assertion is that there isnt enough evidence to conclude that law enforcement, as an institution, condones the shooting of unarmed black people simply because they are black.  We all agree that something like the George Floyd incident was particularly heinous. That wasnt even police brutality, that was murder. But statistical data, even the ones reported by the Washington post, does not show that unarmed black people are being killed on a routine basis, or even that they are killed more than whites.   Even some of the anecdotal evidence, that the media likes to showcase, isnt particularly persuasive when you dig deeper into the facts. Like the Breonna Taylor example you gave, she was killed during a shootout between the police and her boyfriend. The police was there to serve a warrant, her boyfriend shot at the police (one of the officers was hit) and the police shot back. She was killed in the crossfire. You can argue that the police shouldve executed the raid better, but it is simply dishonest to suggest that she was shot for being a black woman.  Lets also look at Jacob Blake who was 100% armed. He wasnt there to stop a fight. He was there because his girlfriend called the cops and he had a history of domestic abuse. Just 6 months before this incident he broke into the womans house, forcefully stuck his fingers in her vagina and told her it smelled like shes been with someone else. He tried to take the womans car and her kids. Then he fought with the police, got up after being tased three times, and had a knife in his hands. (He also had a history of trying to stab police officers.)   Many of these incidents are a farcry from police shooting unarmed black people simply for being black. But to push this type of false narrative can have pretty bad consequences, not unlike the assault on the capital by trump supporters.  Lets just look at Kenosha, where a city was burned and local businesses were destroyed for the sake of Jacob Blake. Many of those businesses were owned by immigrants and minorities who worked hard to build something for themselves. They didntt shoot anyone. They are not white supremacists.

"Not sure John Sullivan is someone we want to be defending  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Sullivan was treated with suspicion in left-wing activist circles, labor activist Talia Jane said he is ""reviled throughout the activist space"", and noted he had been escorted from a December 12 event at Black Lives Matter Plaza after he was identified.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Earle_Sullivan#cite_note-Mackey-2) Many suspected him to be a double agent working for law enforcement. An activist from Portland warned people not to trust him, after he got local activists arrested in September 2020 by leading them down a wrong route and into a police kettle. Anonymous activists from Seattle published a memo in November 2020 accusing him of being an agent  provocateur , pointing to him getting activists arrested or exposing their identities. Activists noted that his brother is a pro-Trump supporter, a supporter of the ""Blexit"" movement and speaking at a Proud Boys rally. After a man was shot in Provo during the protests in summer 2020, a right-wing militia started appearing to police Sullivan's group. During one of his rallies, Sullivan handed the microphone to a Proud Boys member. According to Lex Scott, he told them that his group wanted to work with them, which led to other left-wing activists refusing to work with him. He later got his group firearms training. As he began carrying assault rifles to protest, this invited hostility from both the right and the left.   &gt;   &gt;Others believe Sullivan exploited the racial justice movement for self-gain. Lex Scott said that Sullivan seemed to have ""a death wish"" as he thought it would be ""cool, or amazing, if he was killed at a protest and it started a revolution"". She has also denied Sullivan is a member of BLM-Utah and expressed suspicions of him seeking fame, adding he never attended any BLM meetings nor worked alongside them to advance their agenda. T*he Salt Lake Tribune* reporter Robert Gehrke also stated that he had been selling merchandise and indulging in self-promotion on many websites: his Insurgence USA website sells protest-related gear, such as black clothing, gloves, and gas masks, branded ""bloc gear collective"".

"That's never what it was supposed to be. CHAZ/CHOP was a completely spontanious no-cop protest zone that was essentially forced into being by calculated moves of the police. Before it's establishment, cops pushed back hard against BLM protesters, escalating violence, etc. After this violence escalated more and more, police suddenly made a 180. National guard was called back, the police abandoned their police station and basically handed the territory over to the protesters, stating that they ""wanted to do something else"" and focus on ""deescelation and rebuilding trust"". Maybe it just got too much for them and they wanted to regroup, maybe they thought that the protesters would just burn down the police building and give them a justification to use violence, maybe they hoped for something like CHAZ to happen.  Anyway, needless to say, many protesters didn't trust this whole thing and there were a lot of disagreements what to do with the situation, but a police free protest zone was set up in the spirit of a [temporary autonomous zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone). Similar to other occupation protest zones like occupy wallstreet, the goal was never to create a new country or to create an alternative to our current society, but to build a space where protesters can organize. One of the main inspirations of temporary autonomous zones were pirate enclaves in the 17th century, small communities that existed at the same time as strong governments, but they kinda existed outside of the law. Those communities were never perfect communist utopias or anything like that, but they existed outside of the law.  So from the very start, you had a lot of different groups and factions from different backgrounds (anarchists, black organizers, BLM protesters, social media influencers, local residents and businesses, ...) who had to somehow get on the same page.

"You mean the same officers that couldn't get the resisting Floyd in the police vehicle in the first place? Floyd was a very large man. Again, he himself was the one that insisted on going to the ground (""I'm going down""). The restraint was by the book and standard procedure is to wait for backup to arrive.  &gt; strangling him   Even if you're going to assert that excessive force was used and that the police actions are directly responsible, it wouldn't even have been strangulation that killed him. It would be the weight being placed on his lungs, not the throat, that was impeding oxygen. People yelling they can't breathe aren't being strangled. Of course, Floyd was saying he couldn't breathe well before he was ever even being subdued. Even then, you're talking about a presumptive smoker, with Covid, high on Fentanyl and Meth, with preexisting cardiovascular health conditions with a history of swallowing drugs while being arrested.  Check out his arrest video from 2019, see if you can spot a pattern: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o)  * 1:30 - Fumbling, disobeying orders to keep hands visible, officer pulls gun, office threatens tazing, Floyd swallowing something, ""Don't shoot me."" ""Don't beat me up"" * 3:18 - ""My momma, man!"" * 3:45 - ""Somebody help me! Oh my God!"" * 5:14 - ""That ain't right, man!"" * 5:51 - Drugs (""powder""). Newports on the floor.  * 8:00 - ""He was eating it"" (drugs)  Amongst many others.  Would George Floyd have had a different outcome had he just got in the police vehicle in the first place?

"&gt; Kyle was there just to kill people, the fact that he didnt render aid to Rosenbaum is proof.  This fits the definition of a real actual straw man.  Here is why - I never stated this.  What I actually states is that Kyle was *not* there to ""protect property"" as stated - because threatening someone with a weapon to protect property would be a crime. This means why Kyle was there is *ambigous* and open to interpretation.  What we know is that there was a curfew order and police deployed to address riots.  Kyle, a resident of a city miles away and with no publicly known personal family, property or business interest in the vicinity arrived on the scene open carrying a rifle and commiserating with other armed ""militia"" groups who were active during these events.  Bringing a firearm to a place where law enforcement have specifically ordered you to avoid is not illegal, but killing someone in that context absolutely can be a crime.  Even when it is self defense.  &gt; That is a lie of omission because you DIDN'T mention that gunshots were STILL going off by an unknown gunman.   You are fixated on the immediate context of what's on the video.  You ignore the context of the person arriving on the scene and their self-identified justification for being there (which doesn't make sense).  &gt; It is a lie of omission to not mention that a mob of people were literally shouting cranium that dude at Rittenhouse, thereby justifying a fear for his life.  Sure, lots of criminals confronting criminals fear for their life.  You haven't proven Rittenhouse is not a criminal - you are merely hounding on the idea that he was scared for his life.  &gt; It is a lie of omission to not mention that Kyle, on fucking camera, was caught cleaning graffiti and offering/giving medical aid to the rioters.  Irrelevant.  If we had video of Rosenbaum cleaning the walls before Kyle shot him, what would that mean?  Nothing.  He attacked Kyle and characterized his own criminal intent before he was killed, end of story.  &gt; And heres 100% proof, at least to me, that you are OUTRIGHT lying when you say that you watched the footage/trial: after shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse called his friend Dominic.   Sure, just like if *I* were to shoot someone who was breaking and entering on my property, *I* would also call ""Dominic"" because he has all the answers.  Certainly I would think of ""Dominic"" before I considered 9-1-1 or addressing any crowd of shocked strangers on the street watching a human bleed out on the ground while I'm chatting with ""Dominic.""  &gt; The fact that you didnt try to twist and weasel that fact into your KyLe Is GuiLtY lies is damning evidence to me. I mean, why WOULDN'T you mention it if you knew about it? And why didnt you know about it if you actually watched the footage?  Raising this point actually strengthens my assertions because Kyle's call to Dominic affirms that he made zero attempt to render aid or to de-escalate the situation after he shot someone attacking him and characterized himself as a criminal by fleeing the scene.",tensor(0)

If the GOP sued, they'd win and then we'd have a choice: either immediately deport these young people in college or pass immigration reform. Most Americans are not willing to deport children, so reform was most likely. Any bill would be shaped by the Dems, letting them control the process.  The GOP did the only thing they could: not sue.

"Although its illegal to fire an employee in retaliation for union organizing, employers spend extraordinary amounts of money finding legal workarounds. They will hire labor consultants, high-priced law firms, and PR firms to avoid unionization.  My coworkers &amp; I led 3 organizing campaigns at my former workplace over 6 years. We were very active and tied our 1st vote, won our 2nd vote, &amp; list the 3rd after our ranks had been decimated.  Management spent 2 years refusing to recognize our winning vote while picking off the pro union employees for unrelated reasons and creating such a toxic environment that workers were regularly crying in their cars in the mornings before walking in.   Ultimately, management did a reorganization and eliminated the position with the most active union leaders, including me. I had been there for 17 years. Most of my coworkers had 5-15 years of seniority.   This is a nonprofit day program supporting adults with DD/ID in MA. We had ongoing, important relationships with our participants that management did their best to sever completely when firing us, or as their law firm put it, laying us off.  The regional NLRB came down on our side 3 times, but the national board overturned them. No recourse.  Most of us would still make the choice to organize, but Id tell you to go in prepared for full on open class war. Its ugly and its risky, but its far more honest than supervisors/HR pretending to have your interests at heart while actually upholding the interests of the company in efficiently maximizing your ongoing exploitation.   It was an amazing experience and my former coworkers are now far more invested in/aware of working class politics. Before the union campaigns, I never would have imagined that so many of my coworkers would eventually come with me to picket lines, marches, rallies, and happily stand with my comrades who they now view as people who materially support their interests.   Props to you for seriously considering taking this on.

Sometime in 2011 is when my manager was fired (no notice, no reason given, just before his 20th year with the company) It was the key reason why I quit that same day.  10yrs of working or a company that was firing it's longer experienced employees.       But what really pissed me off...  was discovering in 2016...  That the 401k I HAD (my part/company matched), was spent by RS execs back in 2012, and Texas's 5th circuit court upheld RS corp's standing that they could take the 401k investments, put it into RS stocks in hopes to rebound the value.    Yep.. they rebounded... enough for the execs to cash out.  ...in 2011.       Freelance ever since.",tensor(1)

"My father in law is immunocompromised and would have some rough odds if he got covid. His wife is choosing to take vitamins and reluctantly wear a mask and will not get vaccinated. Their son that lives with them never bothered to take the time to get the vaccine and now has covid and is staying in a hotel room so not to infect his dad. He says he will get vaccinated once he can now. None of these people are Trump supporters.

There are multiple issues with this standard, though. Is someone who is comatose no longer a person because they are incapable of consciousness or noticeable thought? What about newborns, who may have some level of consciousness but not much in the ways of independent thought? When does the valid metric of ""consciousness"" to be considered a person start? Is it a gradient? It's a very indefinite and shaky method of declaring personhood as opposed to ""a person is a living human being"" which definitively begins at conception.  &gt; ""Abortions are never medically necessary""?

"&gt;BCH is already a fork from BTC. It's the weaker of the two.  Yes, but that is largely being driven by speculation and not use. It's more a malinvestment driven by inflation, BTC is the oldest and more well known. And I mean the entire stock market, people don't look at profits of a business as much as how much they think they will get when they sell the stock in the future.  As a result it is better to consider the long term and not the short term. It's basically a bubble that will eventual pop when people realize what BTC is and what it isn't.  But I also share my concern with the stability of BCH in the sense of forks. BCH has gone through several forks actually (BTC, BSV, ABC), and there really is nothing there to reduce the likely hood of another civil-war fork occurring accept assurances by developers who right now don't see a reason for forking. But There was ideas a long time ago such as sub-chains that allow for different algorithms to exist in the same blockchain but no one has really made effort to implement those.  And I feel like Dash having a governing model is better than BCH in that regard, but there are other features besides governing that can be more important such as privacy is a big issue that needs to be solved, and BTC is far and away from doing anything about that, and it's another reason the BTC bubble will pop.",tensor(0)

"I don't know the specifics of the case you're speaking of, but I also am questioning whether you know either. I'm currently living in Philadelphia and know that Prevention Point (the needle exchange that has operated since 1991) is a point of pride for most liberals in the city. My friends and I carry Narcan. But I figured maybe I didn't know the whole history so I read [this article)[https://justingero.com/a-brief-history-of-philadelphias-syringe-exchange/] and found out that needle exchange was started in 1991, and made legal by the Mayor in 1992 and has operated legally every since. The majority of opposition happened at the state level so I don't know where the double standards are supposed to be here. Maybe you're saying that the state was run by democrats and so was the local government? It's not double standards for different people to hold some similar beliefs and other contradictory beliefs. This post is about Lindsay Graham publicly attacking an opponent for not showing his taxes while Lindsay Graham has spent the past 4 years supporting a president who famously has been hiding his taxes while simultaneously using the presidency to make himself rich.

And there's also a time component here. You're example of democrat (not-so) double standards is from literally 3 decades ago, when most the people reading this subreddit weren't even born. The double standards of the republicans are right now, and they are destroying this country. 

But that's not even the comment I started out trying to make. That's the comment I had to make after I did 10 seconds of research about your comment (literally ""history of philadelphia needle exchange"" into google and the first result completely contradicted your story).

The comment I want to make, and I hope you're reading this far, is that yes, democrats are guilty of hypocrisy. The human brain is riddled with cognitive flaws as a result of evolving to climb trees and hunt antelope and now living in an insanely complex environment with our primitive monkey brains. Having cognitive biases is the default state of humanity and everyone will be guilty of it from one time or another.

The thing that separates the modern left from the modern right (generally speaking) isn't the ""conservatives have double standards"" part of my comment, it's the ""conservatives have no other standards"" part of my comment. What that joke is meant to allude to is that the modern American conservative movement is leaning HARD into their cognitive biases. The fact that the most destructive person literally since hitler is currently ruining this country on a daily basis and the right hasn't rebelled against him shows that the sunk cost fallacy has completely over taken the conservative zeitgeist of 2020 America.

Trump has killed 200,000 people. He spent 4 years juicing the economy with tax cuts while simultaneously burning our diplomatic relationships and soft power. That's the economic equivalent of doing steroids while nothing but junk food. The left is constantly debating abandoning Biden under the bus for decisions he made 30 years ago while the right is still championing the man who in 3 short years threw away much of what made America great.

Sure, everyone is individually susceptible to cognitive bias. But the Republican party has made cognitive bias the core of it's platform. And if you're ""conservative"" I don't get why you're more upset at me pointing out these biases than you are at the con-man-in-chief who is dragging the word ""conservative"" through the mud on a daily basis. Like I'm making jokes now about how ""conservative"" is a bad thing, but the actions of conservatives in office will make ""conservative"" a dirty word for the next generation.

"&gt; What a retort, are you actually going to contribute anything meaningful to this exchange? There are not only theoretical models but also practical proof of it's existence and viability, mainly in the form of small societies, often primitive ones, however there is no reason not to extend them further. 

When tried on a big, national stage, have they been successful?


&gt; How can a non-monetary society interact and thrive with a monetary one? The issue being a communist society cannot coexist with a capitalist one, except if it isolates itself from it. While that might sound reasonable for small communities, to me isolation is not the answer, we need to unite ourself as a species, the entire planet and not fracture in the smallest possible units based on ideology, we are one people and have one planet, we should act accordingly.

So what happens when 50% of society is down and the 50% says ""nah""

Well some of us like our sovereignty, and also like our capitalism

This is again part of communist wishful thinking. That we can get 90% of the world population to agree 

&gt; There is no central planning, each village, each district, each city, each province and each region would organise itself based on their own people's councils and their visions.


That's the def of central planning 

 

&gt; Am I forced to follow today's society? Indeed I am, that is how democracy works, the dictatorship of the many over the few, although 

Not really: no one is stopping you and your socialist Freinds from engaging in such manners and you can create worker owned co-ops

Go ahead 

&gt;  find it awkward to believe a sizable majority would oppose it once properly educated on the matter and before you say anything, yes, people have not seldom worked against their own interests, 

I've learned a lot about communism: oppose it 100%. 


&gt; Few would oppose something beneficial to all of us, except for those with a broken moral compass and eventually those would disappear, since, as said previously, the environment shapes us and our views. As Locke said, tabula rasa.

Many more have learned about communism: still oppose it 

Those who have been the victims of failed communism really do oppose it 

&gt;But that doesn't show a fault in capitalism, it shows a fault in those who want unlimited growth
&gt;
&gt; Those who want unlimited growth are capitalists, or are they not? Because those pushing this idea are the one who own the means of production backed by staunch economists.

Interesting:

So should we blame communism for the actions of those who support it and have tried it in the past?

&gt; Good luck with that, about 97% of pieces required for assembly, on top of the assembly process itself, are produced under conditions not tolerated by western standards, let's see how the masses would react if you were to suddenly drive the price up exponentially and/or how the corporate behemoths would react to their loss of profit.

That's why: you and your communist friends starts a businesses where the production of your products is not done through slave labor. By the products and manufacture it yourselves 

All I'm hearing is running a business is actually hard

&gt; No I couldn't, non-profit works if you start of from zero, not with a mountain of loans and rely very often on donations. What business offering daily consumer goods for purchase is successful with donations? (Provide me with examples, so I can learn from those who have been successful)

Then ask for donations from your communist friends to start the corporation 

No one is stopping you 

&gt; Business also have this thing of being, a business, you know? They have a certain goal, what was the word, ah yes, profit, or at least, sustainability. With a small moon worth in credits, how would that work (going back to my earlier thing of lack of assets/capital)? Precisely, it wouldn't.

So are you saying: worker owned co-ops can't make a profit? Can't be efficient? 

If that business structure is much more efficient than the capitalist one then you shouldn't have a problem 

&gt; Point in case, you are not interested in learning but merely provoking. You are consumed by propaganda, 

Wait; lol, I'm consumed by propaganda

I have a question: do you think capitalism when it has been tried, has worked?

"&gt; I want to try and be clear about this - Not 
&gt; every
&gt;  aspect of 
&gt; every part
&gt;  of 
&gt; every topic
&gt;  of religion is something that Sam has to explicitly make a comment about. 

Of course, nobody is arguing that. Just the main points should be touched on or come up at some point. If he has time to defend the Christian baker who discriminated against a gay couple, I'm sure he has time to tweet against any of the many anti-abortion bills that constantly pop up and ruin countless lives.

&gt;What would he say about it - ""I am against this particular bill"". How would that satisfy people in a way that his current history of work doesn't? 

...Well presumably he'd say things which are consistent with his liberal political views mixed with his critique of religion and his overarching mission of having difficult conversations to correct major issues with the state of society. It's like asking what Dawkins would have to say about a bill to mandate teaching creationism in science classes - well... lots of things. It's his bread and butter, he could write an entire book on it. 

&gt;Why are you mrsamsa aligning with this critique?

I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here. I think it's important for people to be honest and accurate in what they say, and their positions should be supported by evidence. I don't think painting Harris as some staunch liberal is any of those things.

To be clear - a lot of people get defensive when they hear that claim because they think it's an insult. Maybe some people do mean it as an insult, but that's not my aim. I'm a conservative so I don't think it's a bad thing to be right leaning. My only issue is that Harris is much further right than I am on many issues, so it's bizarre that people are painting him as a defender of progressive issues. I understand that the US is heavily right leaning to begin with so supporting gay marriage or legalisation of weed are seen as ""liberal issues"" but still it's very strange to me to think that I probably look like a Marxist or an ""SJW"" in comparison.

&gt;Any even remotely charitable person would:

I'm entirely confident that I've demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that I am a more than charitable person. So there must be an error in one of your assumptions.

&gt;a) read his earlier work on the topic (as I linked to you in another comment)

As noted, you linked me to his comments on stem cell research. I guess his description of embryos can be translated to the abortion debate but it doesn't seem like the strongest defence.

&gt;b) extrapolate his defining of religions arbitrary rules on the rights of women, their body, conception and mortality

Hold on, why are we ""extrapolating"" anything? The claim was that he's already discussed abortion in his work and how it relates to women's rights. 

&gt;and c) just naturally have zero reason to suspect Sam would somehow be against abortion.

I don't see how this is relevant to anything we're discussing? I don't think you'll find anyone arguing or implying that he's *against* abortion.

&gt;Any 3 of those points should be enough for someone who is fair and rational. Only the worst kind of critic would see Sam not engaging with this one specific piece of the puzzle as somehow evidence that he is against the abortion bill (which is what OP appears to be arguing, in not so many words).

...No. What?! How did you misunderstand OPs point so badly?

The AJx isn't arguing that Harris is some anti-abortionist, the claim is that if you're going to say he's liberal because he's pro abortion and for women's rights etc, then we'd expect him to have said something about it given how integral it is to every aspect of his work. 

The point is more ""what is the meaning of ""pro-choice"" if it includes people who don't care about anti-abortion bills?"". Saying ""Oh yeah, of course I'm for abortion"" is meaningless if it's just lip service. Think of it this way: when we scientifically measure issues relating to political affiliation, we don't simply ask people what positions they support because most people will say that they support things that they think good people should support. It's a natural bias we have to trying to present themselves in the best light but, importantly, it's often not their actual beliefs. That's not to say that people who pay lip service to being pro abortion are in fact *anti* abortion, it's often just that they don't really care either way - it's a non-issue to them but maybe if pushed they'll say ""yeah, whatever, I guess it should be legal or something"". The argument above is that if someone who held that position (whether Harris or anyone else) was considered ""liberal"" for holding that fence sitting position then that's an extremely low bar. 

&gt;If that is what you're arguing I'm going to need you to explicitly say it before we continue dissecting this.

I'm entirely confident that nobody is saying that he's secretly anti-abortion.

"&gt; This isn't a good solution in the long run, in my opinion. 

Sure, but this is an opinion. I said it *could* be a better solution, not that it would be a better solution. 

&gt;There's more to it than just the money, too - cultural osmosis and integration only works if there's a strong dominant majority culture.

Cultures change over time. The culture of 19th century Britain is different to the culture of Britain today. But this is a cultural argument, rather than a economic argument that you were making in your comment. 

&gt;although on the cultural side, it is more pressing

Why is it 'pressing'? As an Indian guy, my culture might be slightly different to the culture of the majority but I still speak fluent English and partake in 'British' culture. You can have your own culture and still partake in the culture of the majority. For example, I'm a Hindu but I don't mind celebrating 'Christian' holidays, I watch Football with the lads, and speak English fluently. I'm pro-gay-marriage as a 2nd generation immigrant while my parents (educated Doctors) aren't comfortable with it. 

The idea that non-EU immigrants don't eventually converge to the majority is absurd, especially when the majority today will still be the majority (Britain will still be 60% white British in 2081) in 2081. My kids will probably be fully 'British' in the sense that they probably won't be Hindus or enjoy much Indian food. 

&gt;The rate of population increase we'd require to maintain the status quo would rapidly outstrip our ability to develop infrastructure for,

This is an opinion, not a fact. 

Dustmann and Frattini (2014) say that the total government surplus produced by immigration is 25 billion pounds. Government could spend some of that surplus on infrastructure. Obviously, I'm also just speculating here as it's an opinion but it's just a theory like yours. 

My point is, where is the evidence of this and can you cite me statistics/a study that suggests that the rate of population increase would rapidly outstrip the status quo? I'm perfectly happy to accept this opinion as fact IF you have the figures to back it up. 

&gt;The point I was making before, which was what you were responding to, was that I felt that taking in the unskilled workers was not necessarily a good idea. I don't feel that you've overcome that critical part, even with your comments about children. Unskilled workers having unskilled worker children does not produce a positive result for us.

Sure, but my point is that where is the evidence that unskilled workers have unskilled worker children? 

I mean it's probably more likely that unskilled workers have unskilled worker children but can you cite some evidence that unskilled immigrant workers have unskilled children at a rate higher than the average skilled native?

&gt;Thus, I return to my first point - while migration is a net benefit, there are ways we could tweak it to produce even better results, and the most obvious of these is to reduce unskilled migration.

Sure, I think unskilled migration is worse than skilled migration. However, I was just pointing out that unskilled workers can still be a net positive when young and if they have lots of children.",tensor(1)

the reason the japanese metro attacks were dangerous at all is that they were in such a confined space, thus limiting the effectiveness through lack of wider exposure - and US metros aren't as full as japanese metros.

It is 100% payed for and I have no bills as it’s not connected. My question is, let’s say we pass everything, get free health care, pharma, dental, etc. Plus a universal minimum income. In my
Opinion, if all that came to fruition I would quit my job and go out there and live. I wouldn’t see a point of working only to be taxed to death when I can live off grid and just collect my gov check. What does the socialist platform say about people like me who would have this idea.",tensor(0)

"So I just came in here to say that, I started out with guns a lot like you. I didn't like guns, didn't like the stereotypes I saw of people who owned them, didn't like the conservative connotations commonly associated with gun ownership.

Then Trump happened, and the white supremacists got bold, and suddenly, oh shit, *they have guns but I don't.* Okay, I guess I'll get me a gun, or two... but *never a scary black rifle.*

About 18 months later: I purchase my first Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P15, and now I'm considering getting a Troy A4 (both based on the AR-15 platform, in case you didn't know).

So, listen. I respect your views. I read your post and think, ""that was me, 15 months ago."" You want something with plentiful ammo, and plentiful parts.  Well... that's kinda the AR-15, basically. .223 and 5.56 are easy to come by, and if a part breaks on your AR, replacements are easy to obtain and your gun is easy to repair yourself.  It was designed that way.

I get it, you don't want to ""support"" conservatives, and they use **that** rifle. Well, they also use many of the other guns you would consider purchasing, too. They, like many gun owners, consider their guns to be tools, just like a fork, or a car, or a shovel. Not buying a specific model of gun doesn't hurt any particular political group.  It just limits your choices, and in this case runs counter to your requirements for practicality and availability.

That said: there are some options for you.  The Ruger PC Carbine has been mentioned, and is a nice gun. I have one.  You may also want to look at the Ruger Mini 14.

**BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING,** though, consider going to a range that allows you to rent some guns, and try some out. Try a couple handguns... yes, I know, you don't want to carry one around. But for home defense, a handgun can still be quite useful and can get you accustomed to gun ownership.  And yes, try a couple rifles... even **that** rifle.   Doing so gives you the knowledge you need to make an informed decision about what gun, what platform, is right for **you**... which gun works best in your hands, is easiest to handle.  Yes, ergonomics are key even if you're not planning on using your gun for anything. Again, be practical: if some white nationalist busts into your home, you want to have something on-hand that you can manipulate and operate efficiently, not something that's hard to use, too difficult to operate in a crisis. Because then you're not going to eb able to use it effectively, and it'll be even worse than not having a gun at all.

And understand, when you're looking at guns, that **all** kinds of people use and buy all of the guns you're considering.  Bad guys, good guys. Conservatives, liberals. Nationalists, leftists.

They aren't buying a specific model of rifle because it's some sort of identity for them. They're making the same decision you are: finding what's the most practical, the common baseline for easy ammo acquisition, accuracy, ease of use, and repairability.

&gt;To be clear; I have no delusions in using such a weapon to protect myself against the government

I'm going to leave you with some food for thought. In today's impeachment hearings, one of the witnesses (Kent or Tayler, I was listening to audio so I don't know which) gave an accounting of the timeline for the invasion of Russia into Ukraine.  One of the things he mentioned were the common Ukrainian citizens... technology experts, common workers, middle class people... who crowdsourced funding and obtained weapons to act as a stand-in militia while the Ukrainian forces could reform and regroup.  This is a modern day example of how some common citizens with weapons can take part in defense of their country in modern times. Such things can and do happen today, even though we may think it won't happen and isn't possible.",tensor(1)

I agree that the right to defend oneself is of paramount importance and support the rights of law-abiding people without mental health issues to buy any gun they choose.  I don't advocate gun confiscation or anything like that.

I would absolutely love to see better mental healthcare in this country and would love to count on conservative support for healthcare reform proposals such as single-payer which would make it easier for people to go to the doctor and get diagnoses.  However reality is disappointing; I've yet to see any legislative proposals to improve access to mental healthcare coming from conservative legislators even after they respond to gun control proposals with the trope of ""Better mental healthcare will solve this.""

&gt; And do you really think restricting guns is going to work the way it’s intended? I mean we restricted drug use in this country. And yet all people have to do to find cocaine or extract is turn down the right street.

They suffer and sweat trying to feel some sense of certainty about theory that paralyses them, shuts them down in the face of a call to action.

"&gt; If Britain is so hostile/toxic, why do EU and non EU migrants want to  come here on masse, with objective evidence to show we are still a soft  touch in so many areas. As I say, a lot of it is a false and hysterical  narrative that people mindlessly pass on without looking at some  statistics. 

EU migrants just want to get a job that pays more and go back to their home country. Non EU migrants are more desperate and simply prefer to go to the UK because it doesn't require them to get a National Id card or other things to identify themselves (a perfect way to attract criminals, in my opinion). In any case, not the kind of people that the UK actually needs or wants.

As for the rest of your comment... I can only tell you what I can see from outside. I have been in the UK several times and, in 2016, I was even contemplating the possibility of moving to the UK after I finished my PhD and get a job as a Researcher/University Lecturer. After the Brexit referendum, however, half of the people working at the lab I wanted to go to returned to their respective EU countries and that plan was scrapped (along with the lab itself).

And the thing about Covid is that it is going to affect every country, so we will be able to extrapolate the real effects of Brexit next year, when the UK loses its access to the EU market.",tensor(1)

"Moreso than student loans, what needs to be fixed in universities it what causes this attitude. When you go to a university--especially graduate school--you should be learning how to learn. You should be learning fundamentals that can be applied beyond the specific subject that's printed on your degree. Too many schools and too many students treat higher education too narrowly.

My undergrad degree is in astrophysics. There aren't a lot of jobs in astrophysics. Most people I met while in school have jobs outside the field (I'm one of the few who actually works as an astronomer). Some became various flavors of engineers, some went to med school, some went to work in finance, at least one started a business. I was close to starting a graduate degree program in international studies but wound up deciding not to go that route. None of those things have to do directly with the astrophysics degree, but the schools we attended taught us (and we learned) skills beyond what is specific to astrophysics, skills we can apply over a wide range of subjects.

Even if I lost my job as an astronomer and there were no openings in the field, I wouldn't feel like I was starting from ground zero. I'd just look at any number of other fields.",tensor(1)

"&gt;But beyond business and entertainment, the Chinese Communist Party is also spending billions of dollars on propaganda outlets in the United States and, frankly, around the world.

&gt;China Radio International now broadcasts Beijing-friendly programs on over 30 U.S. outlets, many in major American cities. The China Global Television Network reaches more than 75 million Americans, and it gets its marching orders directly from its Communist Party masters. As China’s top leader put it during a visit to the network’s headquarters, and I quote, “The media run by the Party and the government are propaganda fronts and must have the Party as their surname.”

&gt;It’s for those reasons and that reality that, last month, the Department of Justice ordered that network to register as a foreign agent.

&gt;The Communist Party has also threatened and detained the Chinese family members of American journalists who pry too deep. And it’s blocked the websites of U.S. media organizations and made it harder for our journalists to get visas. This happened after the New York Times published investigative reports about the wealth of some of China’s leaders.

&gt;But the media isn’t the only place where the Chinese Communist Party seeks to foster a culture of censorship. The same is true across academia.

&gt;I mean, look no further than the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, of which there are more than 150 branches across America’s campuses. These groups help organize social events for some of the more than 430,000 Chinese nationals studying in the United States. They also alert Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.

&gt;At the University of Maryland, a Chinese student recently spoke at her graduation of what she called, and I quote, the “fresh air of free speech” in America. The Communist Party’s official newspaper swiftly chastised her. She became the victim of a firestorm of criticism on China’s tightly-controlled social media, and her family back home was harassed. As for the university itself, its exchange program with China — one of the nation’s most extensive — suddenly turned from a flood to a trickle.

&gt;China exerts academic pressure in other ways, as well. Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.

&gt;And even scholars and groups who avoid Chinese funding are targeted by that country, as the Hudson Institute found out firsthand. After you offered to host a speaker Beijing didn’t like, your website suffered a major cyberattack, originating from Shanghai. The Hudson Institute knows better than most that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America today.

&gt;These and other actions, taken as a whole, constitute an intensifying effort to shift American public opinion and policy away from the “America First” leadership of President Donald Trump.

&gt;But our message to China’s rulers is this: This President will not back down. (Applause.) The American people will not be swayed. And we will continue to stand strong for our security and our economy, even as we hope for improved relations with Beijing.

&gt;Our administration is going to continue to act decisively to protect America’s interests, American jobs, and American security.

&gt;As we rebuild our military, we will continue to assert American interests across the Indo-Pacific.

&gt;As we respond to China’s trade practices, we will continue to demand an economic relationship with China that is free, fair, and reciprocal. We will demand that Beijing break down its trade barriers, fulfill its obligations, fully open its economy — just as we have opened ours.

&gt;We’ll continue to take action against Beijing until the theft of American intellectual property ends once and for all. And we will continue to stand strong until Beijing stops the predatory practice of forced technology transfer. We will protect the private property interests of American enterprise. (Applause.)

&gt;And to advance our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we’re building new and stronger bonds with nations that share our values across the region, from India to Samoa. Our relationships will flow from a spirit of respect built on partnership, not domination.

&gt;We’re forging new trade deals on a bilateral basis, just as last week President Trump signed an improved trade deal with South Korea. And we will soon begin historic negotiations for a bilateral free-trade deal with Japan. (Applause.)

&gt;I’m also pleased to report that we’re streamlining international development and finance programs. We’ll be giving foreign nations a just and transparent alternative to China’s debt-trap diplomacy. In fact, this week, President Trump will sign the BUILD Act into law.

&gt;Next month, it will be my privilege to represent the United States in Singapore and Papua New Guinea, at ASEAN and APEC. There, we will unveil new measures and programs to support a free and open Indo-Pacific. And on behalf of the President, I will deliver the message that America’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific has never been stronger. (Applause.)

&gt;Closer to home, to protect our interests, we’ve recently strengthened CFIUS — the Committee on Foreign Investment — heightening our scrutiny of Chinese investment in America to protect our national security from Beijing’s predatory actions.

&gt;And when it comes to Beijing’s malign influence and interference in American politics and policy, we will continue to expose it, no matter the form it takes. We will work with leaders at every level of society to defend our national interests and most cherished ideals. The American people will play the decisive role — and, in fact, they already are.

&gt;As we gather here, a new consensus is rising across America. More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving into the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing’s oppression. But more must follow suit. For example, Google should immediately end development of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers. (Applause.)

&gt;It’s also great to see more journalists reporting the truth without fear or favor, digging deep to find where China is interfering in our society, and why. And we hope that American and global news organizations will continue to join this effort on an increasing basis.

&gt;More scholars are also speaking out forcefully and defending academic freedom, and more universities and think tanks are mustering the courage to turn away Beijing’s easy money, recognizing that every dollar comes with a corresponding demand. And we’re confident that their ranks will grow.

&gt;And across the nation, the American people are growing in vigilance, with a newfound appreciation for our administration’s actions and the President’s leadership to reset America’s economic and strategic relationship with China. Americans stand strong behind a President that’s putting America first.

&gt;And under President Trump’s leadership, I can assure you, America will stay the course. China should know that the American people and their elected officials in both parties are resolved.

&gt;As our National Security Strategy states: We should remember that “Competition does not always mean hostility,” nor does it have to. The President has made clear, we want a constructive relationship with Beijing where our prosperity and security grow together, not apart. While Beijing has been moving further away from this vision, China’s rulers can still change course and return to the spirit of reform and opening that characterize the beginning of this relationship decades ago. The American people want nothing more; and the Chinese people deserve nothing less.

&gt;The great Chinese storyteller Lu Xun often lamented that his country, and he wrote, “has either looked down at foreigners as brutes, or up to them as saints,” but never “as equals.” Today, America is reaching out our hand to China. And we hope that soon, Beijing will reach back with deeds, not words, and with renewed respect for America. But be assured: we will not relent until our relationship with China is grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and respect for our sovereignty. (Applause.)

&gt;There is an ancient Chinese proverb that reads, “Men see only the present, but heaven sees the future.” As we go forward, let us pursue a future of peace and prosperity with resolve and faith. Faith in President Trump’s leadership and vision, and the relationship that he has forged with China’s president. Faith in the enduring friendship between the American people and the Chinese people. And Faith that heaven sees the future — and by God’s grace, America and China will meet that future together.",tensor(0)

- Quality stuff. I think you did the ADD podcast (90 minutes?) a while back, yes? I was a big fan of that. I even sent it to my mom, though I doubt she ever listened to it (which is a reflection on everything in that equation but you, trust me). 

- Take a look at [this short post](https://theindependentwhig.com/haidt-passages/haidt/conservatives-understand-liberals-better-than-liberals-understand-conservatives/) containing an excerpt from Jon Haidt’s book. Haidt’s study is a well-calibrated one. He asks liberals and conservatives to “pretend” to be the other tribe as they write short paragraphs. The conservatives pull it off, the liberals do not, the far left are even worse. This needs explaining. 

- Assuming it wouldn’t be too rudimentary for you, you should listen to this audio course: [Explaining Social Deviance]( http://m.thepiratebay.org/search/Explaining+social+deviance+/0/0/0). (I’ve listened to 50-70 TTC courses. That one is in the top 15%.) Even if you don’t learn anything, sometimes it helps the theorizer part of your brain just to be in the “on” position with neurons firing.

Brass tacks: 

You’re coming to a lot of the same conclusions I’ve come to from different angles. 

One, the internet is, as you say, the erasure of geographic boundaries—among others. I think the biggie here is that racial and national “discourse communities” (linguistics term) are at least half-open to outside observation if not participation, whereas before they were mostly “black box.” (This is not to say that I can peek into /r/arabs and understand the subtext of the conversations being had. But I can look.)

This unboxing has created a massive problem. Before, when isolated, the Europeans could talk endless shit about Americans without Americans knowing, caring, or being affected in any way. Now, there is a massive “tiff” between the two continents, and it’s having real-world political implications. The President can publicly doubt our commitment to NATO, and even his detractors don’t get THAT pissy about it. It’s not on their shortlist of things they hate about him despite easily being the item of (potential) greatest global effect. Eisenhower famously said going to the Oval Office from his position as NATO chief felt like a step down. 

In simple terms: men and women, privately, amongst themselves, question the sanity of the opposite sex. It’s a healthy part of same-sex bonding... so long as it doesn’t go overboard, and so long as the opposite sex can’t hear you. Now, everyone in every group can hear every other group. This is bad, bad, bad. It’s made even worse by the fact that on the internet, the “overboard” people find each other and multiply and compete for hyperbole. 

So: these groups had largely achieved a stasis of non-conflict via black box discourse communities. Now, everything is in the open. Of course there’s conflict. What else would there be? 

Note, however: 

This pattern is not universal. Look at sports communities like /r/cfb (college football). Pre-internet, strong in-group bias (“homerism”) reigned; discourse was geographic and often non-overlapping (excepting where you have 2 teams in one area). What now? Strangely, not conflict. Perhaps because there are 128+ tribes, an equilibrium is achieved where excessive favoritism is punished as deviant, instead of rewarded as in politics. 

On domination: 

The single most worrying tribalistic behavior I see on the internet is what I call “neck stomping.” You have a user comment that’s already heavily, heavily downvoted and massively, massively scorned upon. The user is completely and totally “socially defeated,” to use your terms. 

What happens here? IRL, in a fist fight, the thorough winner is expected to let up. A knowledgeable professor, having swatted away an undergraduate’s objection, downplays the student’s wrongness and magnanimously moves on. 

But online, the neck stompers crawl out of the woodwork and take sucker punches (with their feet) on the guy’s metaphorical limp and bloodied corpse. They take bigger punches than they would ever take in any other situation. 

Keeping in mind that it’s “just the internet” and no physical harm is done—fine, fair, but the same is true in the classroom example—what personality type is prone to this kind of behavior? I don’t know what you call it, but it’s the absolute worst category of human being. Truly, I think the SS was disproportionately made up of these kinds of guys. Without these hyenas, Hitler couldn’t have done what he did. 

Last thought, off-topic: 

There are critical missing discourse components in online discourse. One is the often silent, group-wide “c’mon, buddy.” For use when someone totally jumps the shark. Sometimes it’s an eyeroll, sometimes it’s a groan, but it’s a group-wide rejection of a line of logic as being “extra ridiculous.” It’s phenomenally powerful. Nothing else causes reassessment quite like a group-wide “c’mon, buddy.” 

The internet, by virtue of our commenting systems, lacks this entirely. And there is nothing to fill the gap. Hence, reassessment is dramatically less frequent. Hence, we become more “ideologically” (for lack of a better word) rigid.",tensor(0)

I don't say these things to give you a big head, besides which if you've come this far I doubt you'll lack humility. I do however want to thank you for the contribution you're doing for the community. Too many here seem to want to idolize the famous (e.g. tucker) and yet we have people like you crafting logic that IMO surpasses or at least equals anything they come up with. 

-----

As for your comment. I was about to disagree, but I can't really. I was going to argue that a negative societal action that we'd never wish to see occur can't merely be assigned a negative value, because we're supposed to always expect those things to be wrong. For example, genocide or slavery are things we simply can not even bring into any discussion. With this I was going to say your calculation was flawed.

However, you're right. Even if we're discussing genocide all we really need to do is assign it a massively low number (e.g. -999999999) and therefore the chance of the positives outweighing it are virtually impossible, yet still within the real of possibility. This is ironic, because you're an atheist and yet the best example of this was the global flood with the noah story. Such a hugely massive murder of ""innocents"" is always touted as a sign that god is evil. However using your formula, we just need to consider if there was a balancing factor that brought the equation positive. Heck we might even say this is an equation for good and evil, since the good would act when the value is positive will an evil person would prefer the number to consistently be negative,

&gt;  it also neatly settles that tedious ""deontology vs. consequentialism""

I simply hate consequentialism, but I have to agree that this does change my perspective on it. I still refuse to accept that the ends ever justify the means, but I can't fault your logic here. So instead of me admitting I'm a consequentialist on this basis, I will choose the out you've given here to say that perhaps it is a blending of the two. Deontology assigns the numbers and consequentialism gives us the equation.

"&gt; TAA isn't doing as well of a job then. I live in a rustbelt area dude, and places are closing up and moving to mexico. You might be able to hand wave it as 1% of the people, but there are people really in pain.

It works, and it has employed approx. 900,000 people since NAFTA passed. But it does, admittedly, have shortcomings though. 

In order to qualify your job has to have been lost directly because of trade that was made doable because of NAFTA, which only represents a fraction of the total negative impacts NAFTA could've had on the economy as a whole. So it's possible to lose your job because of NAFTA, but since it wasn't *directly* because of NAFTA, you don't qualify.

But this aside, what lots of people fail to see with trade is how it impacts the economy as a whole. And this is because this impact is hard to see. 

You can point to a bunch of people and say ""They lost their jobs because of NAFTA"", but you can't point to a guy and say ""Because average wages went up by some small amount, his and most American's standard of living was made slightly better directly because of NAFTA"". 

If a trade deal is a wash for us, it *looks* disastrous for us, because you can see the bad much more easily than the good. But the good is there, and if you're making national policy you have to weigh all of the things that are there, no matter how difficult they may be to see.

In the end we may never see eye to eye when it comes to trade, but I hope you put more thought into these unseen factors you might not have noticed or cared about before. Such as how a trade deal affects average wages, GDP, general unemployment, gained employment from jobs created by the trade(and they do exist, even for NAFTA), and everything else.

"It’s like Rosanne Barr said - she didn’t change. It’s liberals that changed. That’s partly what leftism is - it moves with the times and morphs to appeal to popular thought at that time. For the next generation, it’ll be different again as they push boundaries even further. 

During his time, Hitler was a mainstream leftist. The most comprehensive paper I’ve found on this is here: http://johnjayray.com/hitler.html - it’s written by a doctor of psychology and university lecturer in psychology and sociology and is very, very good reading. 

The leftists try and disassociate their ideas from Hitler but I’m afraid he was one of them. Modern liberals are like Hitler and Mao. They hate people with money and want to take it from them.

I told him that I didn’t think we needed “assault” type rifles, large magazines, etc. (was more into hunting at the time than firearms themselves). He told me that largely he agreed, but every single gun measure they pass is just a “foot in the door”, that they would never be satisfied with whatever passed, and would immediately ask for more.  I, at a much higher volume, responded with “NO, they only want  the ASSAULT rifles”. He simply responded with- “ok, we will just watch and see, then”.

"Well, I won't presume to know why our Canadian friend thinks her being the target of attacks is a good thing, but I'll tell you why I do because I happen to agree.

Strictly speaking on the quality of political longevity...

It shows me that Hillary can be tested, time and time again, and still come out strong. It shows she has resiliency and is able to handle whatever is thrown at her. Nothing has taken her down. She's faced more than any of us ever have, even more than most politicians, in fact.

She's been in the public eye, doing public work for decades, even before Bill was elected governor of Arkansas. She's long been an advocate for expanded health care and pioneer for equality for women, which of course, made her a political enemy and target of many who resisted that change. As First Lady, of both Arkansas and later, the United States, she was determined to play a major role in shaping U.S. policy. Again, the political naysayers came out because she was sticking her nose where it didn't belong, accusing her of various things including abuse of her position, though she was never actually found to have done anything wrong. She was publicly humiliated around the world when her husband cheated on her in the White House. And then she was ridiculed by some for sticking with Bill, to preservere in order to continue her fight for equal rights and save the Office of the U.S. Presidency any more embarrassment. Even some of the very women she had been fighting for turned on her for something her husband did. 

Afterward, of course, she became a US Senator, ran for the presidency and served as Secretary of State, doing a better job then many of her male counterparts (according to then favorability ratings) while being judged twice as harshly because she was a woman. And still she stands, after all the attacks, aspiring for more.

Most people would not. 

She's been on the front lines her whole life. She's survived everything that's been thrown at her, even her own mistakes. And she's also learned how to deal with those same types of attacks and criticisms that will follow if she's elected.

She didn't give up then and that shows me she won't ever give up fighting for what she believes in. And I say, that's a great quality for anyone, especially a president to have.

"What German Nationalists Don't Get

A common and seemingly reasonable argument for German pride or German nationalism is ""why can't I be proud of my culture?""

Well, you can.  Always have been able to.  We have Germanic paganism groups, we have university programs dedicated to German philosophy and literature, we have political movements that were inspired by German communist thinkers.  Anything of note that's happened in Germany, you can find multiple organizations in North America dedicated to taking pride in it and NO ONE gives them shit for it.

But, you see, when you start talking ""German pride"", that's not a culture.  That's an arbitrary line drawn around a piece of land.  There is no pan-German culture, never was.  Germany is just a place, not a culture.

...

By the way, white nationalism does not live or die on the existence of a pan-European culture.  But consider the following casual reference to ""European culture"" from Nietzsche's ""On the Genealogy of Morality"":

&gt;I understood the morality of compassion, casting around ever wider to catch even philosophers and make them ill, as the most uncanny symptom of our European culture which has itself become uncanny, as its detour to a new Buddhism?  To a new Euro-Buddhism? [p. 7]

Published in 1887.  That's the only reference to ""European culture"" I could think of off the top of my head in older literature, but doubtless there are others.  One reference to something does not validate its existence, but at the very least, we can say that ""European culture"" was not invented solely by white supremacists to carry out their political program.",tensor(0)

The CPUSA is essentially the Democrats painted red.

If memory serves they even backed Hillary Clinton in the election which shows you where their lot falls.

The DSA are a tad more nuanced. They're officially Social Democrats, so rather progressive socially but they still support imperialism and capitalism even if they masquerade it with ""neither Moscow nor Washington"" or ""reform before revolution"" rhetoric. However the DSA is famously decentralised and they often serve as a platform for socialists and communists who lack a serviceable party or organisation in their area.

"Most brokerage houses will not let you buy on margin unless you have a healthy account already built up and then it is only 50% or so depending on your brokerage. So if you had an account valued at $50k they will only loan you $25k. So even if your margin crashed overnight you should still have some value in your account from other investments.  If you're dealing with someone that will let you buy margin with a balance of $0 it's shady AF. 

If you buy stocks on margin and it tanks  you'll get what's called a margin call. If you can't come up with cash to cover the loan (typically enough cash it to get back to 50% value of your account) the broker sells your stock. If your stocks (we are now assuming the market has crashed and your total account value is no longer worth the margin loan) didn't cover the loss the broker can now sell your house. The only way the brokerage could transfer any debt to the government would be to claim the sale of all your possessions did not cover the margin losses and it now goes down as a loss on their taxes. But that not transfering debt, that is paying less taxes because of a true loss. There are private insurances (one house is insured for $70 trillion) and possible bail outs if it's an industry wide thing, but that gets really long and dry.

And I might need to get a better tax guy because my margin interest was not tax deductible, come to think of it my margin interest wasn't even listed on my 1099.  I know I bought on margin,,, I know I paid interest,,,,I need to check it now. 

And you don't pay taxes on unrealized gains because it's not actually money yet. Think of it as buying a painting at a flea market for $20. After a year the artist got famous and your $20 is now worth $100,000. You won't get that $100K until you sell the painting. 

To avoid paying taxes yes I can sell at a loss somewhere else, but that is the least preferred way to do it. I could instead get a secured loan, sell a long position, sell losers without selling gains, or get into tax free government bonds....",tensor(1)

"Personally, the issues I am most passionate about, is the mass poverty that is across our nation and the lack of jobs, which is both a result of Progressive pandering and Big Business meddling. I wish to create a fair and equal market, which allows capitalist enterprise, but makes sure it doesn't expand into the behemoth mega-corporations that back many progressive candidates today. 

Other issues that important to me is our decaying infrastructure and school system. Our education is focused on test scores, and not getting people educated on morals, ethics and how to properly get a job in the real world and the Progressives have done nothing to stop this and have only made it worst, because let me tell you that little quiz will mean jack once you get out to the real world and no wonder why so many of our nation's families are starving and resorting to illegal substances, They aren't taught ethics or morals, or how to even get a Job, all that the Progressives and IT and other Corporate giants do, line them up into a hierarchical system machine-like system which shatters they're will. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our Infrastructure across the country has fallen into ruin it has decayed and needs a serious refurbishment, and assistance. We need to revamp the railway, revamp the road, revamp the highways and revamp our whole infrastructure, modernize it get it in check, because let me tell you if we don't get infrastructure modernized soon, we will fall into poverty, and the oligarchs will just keep getting richer while you and me have to get around on roads and bridges that are collapsing.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue I got is the stripping away of our first two amendments, the Progressives push gun control, push clamping down on the mouth of the individual.  The first amendment allows us to have a peaceful debate, to discuss ideas among each other and agree, but when that is taken away what do we end up as a bunch of iron robots marching in one collum and the second allows us to defend ourselves against criminals, to stop violent acts and to protect our selves from dangerous individuals and help get us out of dangerous situations and taking that away would only spike up violence.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my opinion on borders is simple...I believe we need to vet any immigrants which come from terrorist hot spot and anyone coming from our southern border, we need to work with our western allies and the global community to properly make a list and identity profile of terrorist and suspected terrorist, to make sure these people can't flee to the United States through Europe under a new name or disguise, similar things should be done with our Latin American friends, creating a series of profiles on various gang members and cartels that could try to enter America.

While we do that we also need to patrol our waters for any cartels trying to enter by submarine or raft.

"&gt; I'm calling bullshit on that. 

What?  That someone would keep their word without state intervention or other threats of violence?  It's not bullshit - its basic ethics.

&gt;So by your logic, there's no need for contracts at all since people are just naturally good enough to respect authority and submit to landlords and capitalists by nature or something. Right?

Not at all.  Contracts are a formalized way of keeping your word.  It lays out the expectations of behavior for both sides.  If we agree verbally that you will rent my house, does that mean you can tear out all the interior walls and set up a giant in-ground swimming pool? Or that you can use it as a brothel?  Contracts set firm boundaries and the penalty for breaking those boundaries.

&gt;What's the point in ever invoking private property rights, RPA/DRO, self-defense, contracts, or anything related to that if people are just going to naturally respect it all out of some, I don't know, inborn submission to authority?

You're not understanding.  I'm not a good person because I submit to authority.  Rather, I'm a good person such that threatening me with an authority is unnecessary.  That doesn't mean there won't be disputes.

&gt;Explain your position. Because you know that's all bullshit; you know damned well that without immense State violence you couldn't rent your property out.

Oh?  I know lots of people start renting out rooms TO THEIR OWN KIDS when they get a job.  No 'immense state violence' necessary - just a natural respect for other people's property (which you seem to lack).  Again - this just points the finger back at YOU as being deficient.

The problem isn't rent.  The problem is ethics and culture.  Rent out to good people and the state is irrelevant.  In my time as a landlord, I've given frequent breaks to renters who hit a rough patch.  That is MY side of being ethical.  Their side of being ethical is not taking advantage of that.  I had one former renter who had been out of my house for over a few years call me up out of the blue and offer to pay me a long-forgotten debt of a few hundred dollars.  No state required - just someone trying to be ethical and pay back what they owe.  I didn't take them up on it, like I said it was long-forgotten, but the gesture was heart felt.

Rent out to people who believe like you do and you're damn right I need the state because without the constant threat of violence your low-ethics ass won't pay.  You've proved it as much with your comments.

&gt;You know it, you know that most people would not do it willingly.

Yep - most people are like you - low ethic untrustworthy people.  You're right - I wouldn't rent to people like you without the state (or DRO) backing me up... just like I wouldn't open a jewelry store without hiring guards, and why I wouldn't live in shit-hole neighborhoods without dogs and a security system.  That doesn't mean renting out a home is wrong, or opening a jewelry store is bad - just that there are a lot of low ethic untrustworthy people out there.

&gt;You know that if the State stopped protecting Private Property Owners, most people would stop paying their rent/mortgage the moment they knew that their bank/landlord had no legal recourse against them. 

Yep - lots of low ethic shit-heads out there.  I'm not disputing that.  I'm just saying ""I'm not one of them"" and I have a track record of honest dealings and keeping my word to prove it.  High credit score, zero criminal record, zero days of involuntary unemployment...  and I'm a lazy procrastinating mother fucker.  The bar is low man.  You only need the slightest semblance of some ethics and getting on in the world suddenly becomes easy.

"&gt; I think that a perverse policy in UK political culture leads to the suppression of wages in education and healthcare.

Not just here, and not just those sectors.

&gt; I don't see a similar problem in countries that I would say have a higher standard of living than the UK, such as Sweden (which I just visited this weekend), or Canada, or Netherlands (both of which I recently visited).

The Nordic and Scandinavian countries are culturally quite different from the UK so there is no reasonable basis for comparison.  They are content enough to pay very high levels of taxation, but they also expect a great deal in return from their public governance.

I'd say that Britain expects Scandinavian-standard services but to pay US-standard taxes, which would go a long way to explaining why this country is in such a state.

&gt; However, you should also note that a single nurse can only serve a handful of people each week. However some roles (such as the CEO of a large company) are creating value for many thousands of consumers, and also many thousands of shareholders. The nurse may create much more value than the CEO from the point of view of a single person, but the total value add of the CEO is probably much higher than that of the nurse.

That's a fair point (up to a point) which really only goes to highlight the difficulty in valuing labour.

Case in point: insofar as one individual's output can be reused or leveraged multiple times, design engineers probably represent far better RoI than either CEOs or sales staff, but we don't get paid half as well as either in many cases.

I know and have known many who are far better off than I ever will be.  I'd settle for the prospect of owning my own home, but that probably won't happen, not in the modern environment anyway.

I've learned not to resent it.  It does (would do) me far more harm than the ""undeserving"" objects of my objection.  Life's just not fair, that's the bottom line.  I've learned to be content with what I can get, and adjust my expectations accordingly.

Maybe it's just projection on my part, but I don't see the point in ""envy taxes"".  Progressive taxation, to be sure, but IHT?  No.  Families who've accrued substantial assets have paid for it, as often in intangible ways as others.  I probably have a better quality of life (for now) than they do, anyway, and I prize that over material wealth.",tensor(1)

"Mueller tried to obstruct the 9/11 commission

&gt;https://harpers.org/archive/2017/10/crime-and-punishment-4/2/
&gt;San Diego looms large in the recorded history of 9/11, though not because it was the focal point of the plot. While preparing for the operation, the future hijackers had been dispersed around the country, in such places as New Jersey and Florida. The reason we know so much about the West Coast activities of the hijackers is largely because of Michael Jacobson, a burly former FBI lawyer and counterterrorism analyst who worked as an investigator for the Joint Inquiry. Reviewing files at FBI headquarters, he came across a stray reference to a bureau informant in San Diego who had known one of the hijackers. Intrigued, he decided to follow up in the San Diego field office. Bob Graham, the former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me recently that Robert Mueller, then the FBI director (and now the special counsel investigating connections between Russia and the Trump campaign) made “the strongest objections” to Jacobson and his colleagues visiting San Diego.
&gt;
&gt;Graham and his team defied Mueller’s efforts, and Jacobson flew west. There he discovered that his hunch was correct. The FBI files in California were replete with extraordinary and damning details, notably the hijackers’ close relationship with Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi living in San Diego with a no-show job at a local company with connections to the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation.

...

&gt;Jacobson also found evidence, noted but seemingly ignored by the bureau, that Hazmi had worked for a San Diego businessman who had himself been the subject of an FBI counterterrorism investigation. Even more amazingly, the two hijackers had been close with an FBI informant, Abdussattar Shaikh. Hazmi had actually lived in his house after Mihdhar left town. Shaikh failed to mention his young Saudi friends’ last names in regular reports to his FBI case officer, or that they were taking flying lessons. Understandably, the investigators had a lot of questions for this man. Nevertheless, Mueller adamantly refused their demands to interview him, even when backed by a congressional subpoena, and removed Shaikh to an undisclosed location “for his own safety.” Today, Graham believes that Mueller was acting under orders from the White House.",tensor(0)

"&gt; Oh man, you're anti-Hitchens

Selectively. His Iraq War apologetics are garbage and his anti religion work was indulgent and over the top in many cases sometimes being based on shabby research and bolstered by his ever present trump card - rhetoric. He was always at his best when not relying on rhetoric to brute force cheers, but he relied on it far more in his last commentaries compared to his much more admirable early work. In general his New Atheist phase was a real let down.

&gt;and Harris?

Yea, he's basically the definition of the intellectual who defends the state and the status quo. His thought experiments about 'good intentions' are pretty horrendous. Try going over to r/philosophy and go on about how great he is. They'll roll their eyes at the pop culture philosophy book nonsense he sells.

&gt;Do you have more current stats than these? Curious to check that out if you do.

Mexico is definitely a victim of American influence. Between NAFTA and the war on drugs its basically just fucking the country over and the border is right there so its easy to see them move to the infinitely wealthier society that is the top dog in those relations. India has a huge population so the basic number of people living abroad as point of origin is going to be high, especially given the connection between India and western society. In general by nation of origin and not adjusting for something other than pure numbers is not going to be meaningful especially since top 10 per nation doesn't measure much other than in a popular kind of way, like top ten songs, etc. Its just a useful way to format it for mass consumption without trying to make a real point.

But if we're not talking about migrant refugee crisis then fine, the numbers still don't validate Petersen's argument because the UK is on that top 10 list, and many of the countries on that list also note movement across the entire planet, and not just into western nations. His entire argument is I think pretty simplistic. 

&gt;Maybe they were never warned about our racist social structures? Or maybe it's a lesser of two evils kind of thing?

People always want to be in the wealthier country, I already said that. This whatboutism argument is definitely a sloppy argument to be making. Western values are justified because the rest of the world is worse, even though we've had a major hand in organizing and influencing and establishing the dynamics of most of the world's regions and disputes. The ME for instance is a fucking mess mostly from the way we drew the borders ignoring ethnic and regional and cultural and religious lines and of course the ridiculous crime of 2003 that has paid out so incredibly badly since on so many levels and of course the constant picking of winners and losers in the 'who should rule this country' game and the endless fallout and unintended consequences of those actions. Most of central America is a graveyard to even liberal capitalist societies that didn't want to kow tow to American colonial extraction.

Petersen basically just says ""and its not because we stole from them, its because we're better"". Great argument. Colonialism wasn't stealing, it was just superior economic practices! He really is just doing a reinforcing the underlying assumptions of nationalism kind of spiel and his very bombastic rhetorical style in that video demonstrates as much. He's piratically preaching.

&gt;Just out of curiosity, if you were given a week to change anything about the social structures, government, laws, etc. (but not people's hearts/minds) in the United States, what would you change? And what would be the outcome you'd hope for as a result of those changes?

That's a fruitless effort beyond doing basic harm reduction as real change has to come with people organizing to demand and adapt to new structures and resist the existing ones that are inappropriate. You can't change structures without people being on board. Leninism and the vanguard concept tries to short cut this with authoritarianism but that doesn't work.

Anything I could do in that one week would be pointless in the long haul because it wouldn't address the structures correctly, unless I get really crazy and go beyond the pale of anything measured. It shouldn't be top down, it has to be bottom up. The only effort I'd make was removing whatever obstacles exist to people organizing. Maybe I'd leak everything the FBI had on social justice movements, green movements, black political organization, etc. Dismantle the NSA, CIA, and whatever else, and nuke as much of the military industrial complex as possible. Even then that's dangerous because its a whole world of similarly dangerous states. Maybe just some leaks across the board of every secret the US government has, and do as much harm to wall street and the lobbyists and the Koch bros. and everyone else as possible.

Do something to really undermine the confidence and belief people have int he existing order so they'd be mobilized to action and become critical of the things they ought to be and that can build a movement that evolves to challenge things. Opinion is important when controlling the population politically. Undermine that forever and maybe real change could be effected. However its still incredibly dangerous because miscalculations could instead be a kind of accelerationism which is a highly immoral form of praxis I'd never want to be a part of.

"I'm gonna come at this from an angle no one else will.

The end game of socialism has always been a moneyless, stateless, classless environment.

As an expert in non-monetary economic systems, I assure you that the only thing preventing the growth of such a system is socialism itself. We have all of the tools we need, but no socialist seems to be able to figure out how to build it.

And they never will, because they are trying to solve the wrong problem when they approach the idea of ""communism"" as a system: they are trying to solve the problem of unfair wealth distribution, when instead they should be trying to solve the problem of unfair *purchasing power* distribution. As a result, they always begin with the abolition of private property.

And then, they don't realize that the abolition of private property itself is what's making their economic system fail to function, because just like a monetary system, the socialist calculation problem still applies. In fact, monetary systems are somewhat robust and able to withstand some amount of socialism without collapse.

Non-monetary systems cannot; they are very fragile.

If we approach the idea of communism from an Austrian school position (no effort to abolish private property) and instead focus on solving the *real* problem - the objectivity of purchasing power inherent in monetary systems, which is a violation of the subjective theory of value - then we can build a communist system which outperforms monetary systems.

But in the end, that's actually anarcho-capitalism.

I'll answer any questions you have if you have doubts. I've spent half of my adult life focused on this. The system best suited for and closest to a moneyless, stateless, and classless environment is anarcho-capitalism, not socialism. The Austrian school provides a far better framework for its success than the Marxian school.

"Barr’s father Hires Epstein-Time Magazine
https://time.com/5650974/william-barr-jeffrey-epstein/

Looks like I was wrong about an all girls school but don’t let that fool you about the seriousness of what happened there. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-dalton-teacher.html

From the above source:

“In the mid-1970s, students at one of New York’s most esteemed prep schools were surprised to encounter a new teacher who pushed the limits on the school’s strict dress code, wandering the halls in a fur coat, gold chains and an open shirt that exposed his chest.”

“Eight former students who attended the prestigious school during Mr. Epstein’s short tenure there said that his conduct with teenage girls had left an impression that had lingered for decades. One former student recalled him showing up at a party where students were drinking, while most remembered his persistent attention on the girls in hallways and classrooms.”

“I can remember thinking at the time, ‘This is wrong,’” said Scott Spizer, who graduated from Dalton in 1976.

“Mr. Epstein’s time at Dalton was brief, and an administrator said it ended in a dismissal”

“But the accounts offer a window into Mr. Epstein’s early adulthood, before he developed extensive private wealth that allowed him to acquire a $56 million mansion just a mile south of the Dalton School. It was there, prosecutors said this week, that Mr. Epstein and his employees paid “numerous” underage girls to engage in sex acts with him.”

(Read on for more details)

I forgot this first part about the law firm connection to the first deal and a second source about Barr’s father hiring Epstein -New York Times Article(Secondary Sources are provided in the article) https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/william-barr-jeffrey-epstein.html

From the above source:

“Mr. Epstein’s death prompted an unexpected challenge to Mr. Barr’s credibility. The Justice Department has faced accusations that it mishandled an earlier investigation into the financier by making a deal in 2008 that allowed Mr. Epstein to elude federal charges and serve prison time from his office. It also shielded his six known co-conspirators. That deal led to the resignation last month of the labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, who had brokered the agreement while serving as United States attorney in Miami. 

”To quell renewed furor over the deal, the Justice Department opened an internal review. Prosecutors in Manhattan had also opened a new sex trafficking investigation, but Mr. Epstein’s connections with powerful figures all over the world prompted skepticism that charges would ever be filed. Even Mr. Barr had chance ties to Mr. Epstein: His old law firm, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, had worked with Mr. Epstein on the Miami deal, and decades earlier, Mr. Barr’s father had hired Mr. Epstein to teach at Dalton, the elite private school in Manhattan.”

Did I mention he reappointed the lady he hired back in 1992 to be in charge of the bureau of prisons? A long time underling who’s career was made by Barr to be the first ever woman in this position is in charge of investigating the case in which he should be recused stating he needed to  “shake things up” right after the Epstein Murder occurred. https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/19/20812436/bureau-of-prisons-chief-removed-epstein-death-hugh-hurwitz-william-barr

"There is no unified European impression of US politics. Closest thing to it is that the GOP are a bunch of lunatics, which gives the Democrats a good head start right out of the gate.

Among the western Europeans that go online a lot, i.e. younger people, Obama is a lot more like our image (policy/rhetoric wise) of a competent politician than his opposition ever was. McCain was looking ok until Palin, who looks and sounds like a crazy person. Romney was just... weird.

""Obamacare"" is not remotely controversial here, except that it was a bandaid where surgery was needed. Basically every European nation has universal healthcare of one form or another, there are so many different types and models for how to do that that are functioning just fine, nobody has any doubts that such a thing is possible and perfectly reasonable. To hear the American right speak on the matter, it's impossible to do healthcare any other way than to let the ""free market"" deal with it. Comes across as crazy talk.

"we are firmly in the territory of the [demographic transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition). I'm not a demographer or an economist, but I took a master's course in demographics and it was fabulous. people have talked a lot in the comments so far about immigration being a part of this issue of lower fertility rates, so I'll just add 2 interesting things I haven't seen mentioned yet:

1. immigration isn't just a way to have population replacement, immigrants are actively cost-saving: in demographics, people who are 15-64 are considered to be working-age (generating economic growth), and people younger &amp; older are considered dependents (draining more resources than they contribute). most immigrants arriving while they're working-aged, so their new country benefits from not having had to spend money on raising them from ages 0-14. of course I'm describing the theory here, not specific situations; specific immigrants may not be working or generally be a net neutral/negative for a society, but overall the theory is that you save money from not having to invest 14 years of resources in order to get a working-age adult. also, immigrants often bring foreign money, which grows the new country's economy independent of their ability to work. and lastly, the benefits of not having to invest in infants/children/teenagers aren't totally free, of course: they are costs borne by the person's previous country &amp; community. oftentimes immigrants are moving to a country with a higher income than their previous country, and this is one of the significant costs of immigration: the country that raised this person spent a chunk of money in getting them to 15, and don't get to reap the full benefits of that investment.
2. this doesn't have to do with the US or Japan per se, but is a significant economic consideration in the course of countries shifting through different stages in the demographic transition model: some countries benefit from a [demographic dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_dividend). basically, there comes a point where fertility rates are falling and life expectancy is rising, and suddenly there's a lot more working age adults (ages 15 - 64) and a lot fewer children, compared to before. so the adults who would've been spending a big chunk of their time on their kids instead of increasing GDP are no longer having to spend so much time rearing children (because of declining fertility), and plus they're spending more years of their lives working (because of rising life expectancy). this extra productivity is called the demographic dividend (here's an [invesopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demographic-dividend.asp) on this very topic). [China is thought to be benefitting from this right now](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-population-destiny-the-looming-crisis/): the demographic dividend ""is estimated to have accounted for 15 to 25 percent of China’s economic growth between 1980 and 2000"". this dividend eventually ends though, as life expectancy rises to be far beyond working age. after all, 65 is pretty young in most high-income countries. elderly people cost money because a) they're not working and are still drawing resources, and b) the older people get, the more expensive their healthcare gets, and healthcare is a major, major cost for a country. even if people work to their 70's, many still live another 10-15 years, and each year is a net cost to the system. which we are also seeing in China right now: growing numbers of working age adults now are needing to support their 2 parents (where they are sole support due to the 1 child policy) and sometimes even 4 grandparents. by support, I don't only mean financial support--the more significant loss is that they can't work because they need to spend a good deal of their time &amp; energy caring for the family members who are 65+.",tensor(1)

2. If I choose not to accept this switch to another department and apply for CERB without my RoE (as it doesn't seem mandatory to have it at the moment), does this mean that I'd be asked to pay it back at a later date since they did eventually offer me more hours?

"Don't waste your time with him. I'm from India, and what this guy is talking is shit. Only some lunatics associated with the Communist ideology think that pre-1991 was better. They just take a random stats here and there and try to prove that we are worse off. 

Literally no on except few idiots think that way. The service sector was the first to be liberalised, and now the service sector sustains the whole economy. The manufacturing sector till extremely recently worked on the basis of socialist polices, and it is the weakest sector. Same with the agriculture sector.

The communist ideology is now almost nonexistent here. Just like everywhere else, they are extremely loud and make huge noises, but in the electoral, they are absolute shit. All the communist parties together got only 1.3 crore votes in the last election. Modi's vote increase from last election almost was almost 6 crores. Meaning that Modi's vote increase from last election alone was 6x times the total vote all the communists had in the total country. The congress party which is Modi's primary opponent, and the party was earlier socialist and now capitalist, itself has a support which is 12x the total support all the communists have. Modi almost have 22x total support. Combine both of them and you will see how happy people are with the post 1991 reforms. And here is the thing, these parties work with other alliances, and those alliances are also in general capitalists. Bottom line is, few idiots online think they represent the views of a country, but they are an extremely small minority with defunct economic ideologies.

Modi can today ask 6 times of the total MPs the communist have to resign and still have a majority govt with his party alone. The previous Prime Minster Manmohan Singh was also a capitalist, and his regime had the best economic growth in the History of India with GDP rate sometime crossing 10%. Literally everyone is happy with the capitalist structure except a bunch of high culture communists. The poor will feel the impact of the poverty, and their support of the capitalist parties show that they feel they are better off now.

"ah but if the nano-bots are in our brains and just need signals sent to them in the form of radiation which is easily disrupted by tin foil? you see layered tin foil makes a great blocker because it can have very thin layers with thin junctions between them kinda like how bubble-wrap is such a good thermal insulator. If there was a bug in our brain then the antenna would have to be very small and thus the wavelength of the signal would be only around 3x that of the antenna at most therefore potentially putting it in the perfect range for tinfoil to stop; so while it is letting most longer and shorter wavelengths through it's absorbing the ones of the right wavelength to be detected by the device - essentially then it's being the most efficient possible shield.  
  
The other options are more complex, one is to-do with the resonance in the scull you mentioned earlier in relation to the keyfob test - imagine a large electromagnetic field around a table, you put your hat on the table and nothing happens but you put your keys on the table and field goes crazy but the keys don't move; now if the field has resonant properties with that field onto the table such as a ball of magnet then both will move -- yet you can make a halo of metal and put it around the keys or the magnet and the magnetic fields will move through the metal ring and avoid the magnet thus stopping the interaction. It could be that there is some form of field that resonates with our brains and causes them to exhibit some form of tendency, violence maybe or depression depending on inclination, it could be that this field is controlled at nodal points similar to an electromagnetic engine or motor so that we're being manipulated into exerting great energies counter to our most reasonable aims - maybe tin foil creates a short-cut for the magnetic or electrical field which bypasses our brain and negates any negative effect.

or maybe it's much more complex, maybe the tin foil will help magnify the earths cosmic wiggle rays and by a process of inverseglucuation our previously undiscovered alpine gland will open and radiate light, love and happiness into the world while fawns and baby turtle doves spring from the rift we've opened in temporal space and thus ending the delusion which is humanity and opening our eyes again to the infinite reality of life as an immortal and incorporeal mono-entity. Maybe we fear it for it is the way to reconnect to the ennui hell our insanity drove us so away from?  
  
but to touch on the technical elements once more, it might be possible to elicit brain activity via microwave action evoking heat then charge or the resonance of certain sized and shaped features of the brain such as various glands, nerves or ets - the trigeminal nerve for example might be the ideal length and location to cause a focused second resonance within the hypothalamus which is triggered into releasing it's chemical signals in such a way as purposely disrupts or tricks other parts of the brain into misbehaving... classic prodder style escalation hacking.

Speculating here on what Chomsky would say: It depends on the democracy we’re talking about.

If we’re talking about a small anarchical community with face-to-face egalitarian relations it may be a different story.

"Fair points.

Back in spring and again this winter, covid was definitely killing the elderly in many of the worst hotspots (London, New York, Madrid, etc.). But government policies and interventions accelerated and/or exacerbated these deaths. Namely:

\- discharging covid-positive patients from hospitals to care homes, ostensibly to free up hospital capacity but in fact 'seeding' covid into settings where the vulnerable and elderly are concentrated

\- banning visitors to care homes. As you say, isolation is terrible both in terms of weaking the immune system and making people literally lose the will to live.

\- restricting access to potential treatments and not doing enough to boost elderly people's immune defences. By late March 2020 most governments had banned access to medications like hydroxychloroquine and instead recommended oxygen and/or ventilation for patients in critical care. This likely killed lots of elderly people as ventilation requires that a patient be placed in an induced coma and intubated -- very invasive and quite difficult for the body to recover from.

Not only should less harmful medical options have been considered, but we didn't even do basic things like prescribe every care home resident and person over 75 an immune-boosting supplement regime of vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc. This would've been an easy win.

I think we might have known about covid even without media hysteria, because it did cause some excess deaths in certain hotspots and it did cause some combinations of symptoms that when observed in clusters of people at the same time would raise some alarm (things like loss of smell, headaches and diarrhea). But this doesn't mean that we would've freaked out had the media not told us to.

It could have been like swine flu in 2009. I almost certainly had it, as did several people in my workplace. It was really nasty -- literally the worst flu I've ever had -- so it was clear that something was going around that was bit different to regular flu. But we shrugged it off because that's what you do with any winter illness that knocks you down with fever and fatigue. Covid at community-level could have been like this -- a noticeable but completely surmountable wave of flu-like illness.

And in some places which have never been hotspots, I think you're entirely right to say it might've gone unnoticed entirely.",tensor(1)

But who the heck is John Kasich?

His most touted accomplishment is balancing Ohio's budget; kinda boring. He doesn't seem to have any new ideas, or want to take the country in a new direction. He's just your standard Republican who's only reason for still being in the primary is that he's not Trump and he's not Cruz. On the off chance he's the nominee, that'll piss of *a lot* of Republicans.

Maybe I'm not giving him enough credit, but between: being kind bland; not being well known; not being able to unite the party up to now; pissing off the Trump and Cruz supporters that feel like the nomination was stolen; and the inevitable attacks during the GE that have been largely absent up to this point, it doesn't seem like he has much going for him.

"The ""$15/hour"" movement really contains two separate arguments that should be considered individually:

1. Wages (specifically low-to-minimum wages) have stagnated relative to inflation and they should be raised overall. Potentially to the range of $15/hour.

2. An entry level, full time job, (classic ""flipping burgers"" job) should provide enough income to support an adult individual.

These two arguments are made together in almost all these debates, however, in my opinion they are separate issues.

The wage argument is complex. However I tend to agree with the overall trend that wages, in general, have stagnated and probably should rise. That being said, my opinion is that the wage raises should be targeted more at ""low experience"" jobs, not entry level. For instance, supervisor level type jobs. Many people don't realize that many supervisors in places like McDonald's and Best Buy are barely making around $15/hour (let alone the entry level people).

The second argument, that an entry level job should (by default) be able to support an adult individual, I think is false. They're essentially arguing that a high school student with no work experience should be able to make an adult salary. 

First of all, I don't think that's ever been the case (putting aside exceptions). Second, I don't think that's feasible in the least. Third, even if it was feasible, I'm not even sure it's a good idea because entry level positions provide people on the periphery of the work force (like young people) a chance to gain work experience and make some money. If the pay rate for those positions was so high, I think we would see those people being displaced.

I recall that during the last major ""fast food"" protest about 6 months ago, they interviewed a pizza delivery man who had been making an extremely low wage for many year (perhaps a decade). They asked him why, in those 10 years, did he not attempt to become a manager. His response was that he liked his job and he didn't see why he should have to change in order to make more money. I thought that quote was very revealing.

Personally, I've worked in entry level positions (fast food and retail). Those entry level positions are designed to be *entry level* (i.e., no experience necessary). I think the idea that they should be able to fully support an adult is, quite frankly, ridiculous. Those jobs are not meant to be careers, they're meant as a stepping stone for people that are just entering the workforce. If people are attempting to make them careers, then there is a serious problem. Either our education system or economy is seriously failing. And if that's the issue, I don't think a magic ""$15/hour"" stroke of the pen is going to fix the issue.

**TL;DR: In general, I think wages should be raised because they have stagnated for years. However, the activists' claim that an entry level position should be able to fully support an adult is flawed.**

**I understand that this is a sensitive topic for many. I've tried to be very reasonable in my comment, and I hope we can have a respectful discussion on the issue. =)**

"The business owner is not producing something from nothing. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change forms. The lifestyles of the Rich have always been on the backs of the lower class. 

The most potent image I could allude to here is that of a ballroom dance in the early 20th century. It is the middle of the winter, with women dressed in pearls, and men in suits and tops hats. They are dancing, warm from the brandy and warm from the central heating: the hum of which is masked by the private orchestra. 

The coal burning in that furnace was mined by children, who will die of black lung. 

Who am I to say that the lives of those children is not worth it because of the fact that America became a powerhouse because of the access to coal that the Captains of Industry grace us with. Looking here it seems it would be a damn shame, simply not pragmatic to mine that coal and get the engines running! We have got history to make!

Now we have blood diamonds.

And so quite simply people are dying so that ""the Rich"" can have a certain standard of living.

However, I do not simply think it as simple as sticking the heads of the rich on pikes. As far as I am concerned, I as an American citizen am part of this same dynamic, the 1 percent to many countries' 99 percent, if you will. The phone I type this on were mined in the third world. 

The poor vote against their interests yes, but the same propaganda that gets the poor to vote one way or the other is still the same that much of the upperclass is basing their votes on. 

The second problem is that the higher living standards of say the middle class today, and even the existence of the middle class itself, ignores the fact that by pure population itself. There are more poor today today than there ever has been in the history of the Earth. 

Now is an aboriginal man, poor? We need not use the extremes to make a point. The people in la favellas in Colombia are not going to have access to a standard of living above poverty any time soon. And these are the same people dying to gather and process la coca: the biggest consumer of which is the United States. Now, the cocaine business is UNLIKE coal deaths in that there is no possibility for the cocaine business to help raise standards of living to get the people in the favellas out of poverty. Sure, certain individuals may be able to get enough money to emigrate out of Colombia. But the cocaine industry is not building roads, not building wells and sewer systems. And so the cocaine industry is why the Zero Sum Game thingie isn't as simple as you say.

This can be said of the coal mining industries although it is different since coal is used to power the machines that help produce that which is needed to build roads, etc. This is where Capitalists are correct(if not heartless and pragmatic.) 

But the coal mining industry(of the 20th century) is like the cocaine industry today, in that the consumers were of course benefitting from huge returns(coke is good yo) but the children were dying, and they were not necessarily going to any time soon move on up into a position where they are no longer dying. Now of course we would not have the standards of living we have today if not for these children(so coal industry adds more than cocaine industry, unless you consider freud better than mass production) but it still demonstrates vastly different living standards for two groups of people.

Today, there is clearly a blur between consumer and worker, because of mass production. But there are both clear examples of passive barriers to class mobility, and active barriers. A passive barrier to class mobility being that a rich person is not likely to move down in class because of inheritance and nepotism(why are the Rich in China largely the same as those that were Rich before the Revolution? The answer to this likely being the connections they had.) Another passive barrier to class mobility being poor person is not likely to escape the favellas and become a rich man in LA from working in la Coca fields. 

Now look at the cities during the late 20th century. The factories moved into the suburbs and many people lost their jobs. During this same time, an active barrier to class mobility was redlining of American Blacks. They could literally not follow the jobs. Now this is straight up racism on the one hand. But on the other hand it is the result of factories moving, so touch luck right? This is Capitalist pragmatism at work. This is a way is even scarier than racism because it means you aren't even thought of. You simply exist as a number. And if you lose your factory job, oh well tough luck. This right here connects back to the ballroom dance. These boujee ass mofos aren't even thinking about the poor truthfully. It is the same in my opinion almost as me using a phone with materials mined in Africa. Almost a, its nothing personal, kid. Sort of thing. This is why beheading all the rich is to me laughable.

Another problem with Capitalism is that the level of growth we saw in the 20th century in my opinion is no longer sustainable. On one hand we have the ecological crisis. And on the other hand the only reason the cities grew was to handle the transition from agrarian societies to productive societies. Nowadays the rich can literally paint their balls in gold. Donald Trump has a house with gold leafed everything. There is cynicism in my mind that there is certain stagnation that is occurring in the world where it is not likely the rest of they would be able to grow the same way the USA did. The industries are already made, there is not any industries to stimulate the creation of new cities for the people in other countries. The entire world are consumers because of mass production. Now you can argue here that their time will come, because of innovation, etc. But I will always respond to this that like the diminishing returns of mining Bitcoin, there are these same diminishing returns(actually diminishing opportunity) that comes from the increasing difficulty to create a new industry. Now if you argue that one should here pull themselves up by their bootstraps. I could of course say again, ""diminishing returns."" And if you say tough luck, then I will remark on the fact thay the top 10 percent of the top 1 percent controlling the amount of wealth they control is making it such that there are again passive barriers to class mobility(not to mention the fact that does this mean the third world must rely on charity of the rich to become first world?) that are, inherent in capitalism(late stage especially). The fact that wealth today can in a way, not be created or destroyed, it can only change hands, is ignored by capitalists, and it ignores the fact that there is NOTHING but charity that will flood the amounts of capital into the third world required to help them escape poverty. This creates long term world instability and in my opinion is what people mean when they say Capitalism straight up kills people. Or if you need a more pressing matter(to Americans) it is the same as saying that the millenials being fucked by student loans and not being able to buy houses is going to be bad for home builders, real estate agents, and the economy.

"First of all, it's just flat out not true that no one has accepted speaking fees and then ran for POTUS.  Yet the comment is upvoted, and you believe it.  On reddit at least, the Bernie supporters are the worst spreaders of misinformation.  Drudge Report-esque headlines that are entirely misleading are upvoted without a second thought.

I'm a film producer.  Say I charge a fee of $1,000/day on a project.  The next offer I get is off a referral and they ""offer"" $1,000/day knowing that it's what I charge.  Does that sound that outlandish?  Because if a close friend asked me my rate I might tell them ""They offered me $1,000/day.""

&gt;True plus she didn't even need the money, it just shows her greed.

As I said before, it's absolutely not true, but this hate I see for people that earn a good living on Reddit is truly alarming.  You can be mad at someone for not paying their fair share of taxes, however you might define that.  Or for making money in shitty ways maybe.  But setting up your family or extended family for generations to come because you are in a position to make a lot of money is not morally wrong.  Maybe you're just young?  I have a hard time seeing someone paying rent or a mortgage or saving to take care of a family begrudging someone for making a good living.

The argument shouldn't be centered around greed, it should be centered around Hillary's specific situation.  Personally, I don't have a problem with a former lawyer, senator, and secretary of state giving speeches to the highest bidder.  She did many with her husband, a former president.  Maybe you have firmer numbers, but I have seen that they gave 729 speeches in the last 15 years since he left office, and 39 of them were to big banks.  That doesn't seem outrageous to me.

"&gt;Actually, they don't. The SCOTUS needs to wait for cases to come through the lower courts. They can't rule on Presidential/Congressional actions.

This is factually inaccurate on a lot of counts. The supreme court does not always have to wait for cases to go through the lower courts. Jurisdiction is way more complicated than that. They don't have original jurisdiction in many cases, but they do in some. Even if they did have to wait on lower courts, that wouldn't do anything to respond to the claim that they get the last word. A supreme court decision is binding on the lower courts. Finally, the supreme court can very much [strike down executive actions](https://www.myheritage.org/news/unanimous-supreme-court-rules-against-the-obama-administrations-unconstitutional-power-grab/).

&gt;It is co-equal because the SCOTUS can't enforce their opinions. 

That doesn't make it co-equal. The rule is that the executive has to enforce SCOTUS' rulings. The only counterexamples have been tyrannical lawlessness on the part of the executive. 

&gt;It says they are to be reported to ICE

Cite either the relevant law or a reliable source to that effect. I really don't think the law says that, but I could be wrong.

&gt;Except for the millions of people that disagree with you there. 

Luckily, those millions of people don't interpret laws because that would mean they are very bad at it. The law you think exists simply doesn't exist. There are 100s of years of precedent against you. 

&gt;How so? I've heard the exact opposite from entire classes of people and an erosion of the practice for decades. If less people are married does that mean the nation inherently has less liberty?

This is self explanatory. If you had the freedom to marry who you love, is that more liberty or less liberty?  It isn't about the number of people married it is about having the ability to marry who you want. If I said you couldn't marry people of another race, you would have less liberty. I don't understand the confusion and this is another point that makes me think you are being intentionally obtuse. 

&gt;Such as 1 man and 1 woman. But that didn't hold.

That isn't a reason. There is no actual harm being done to anyone. The exploitation that often accompanies polygamous marriage is. I honestly don't care that much whether this holds, I can't understand why anyone would be worked up about this issue either. If they love each other just as much as everyone else, why not let them get married? Unless you believe there is a bit of truth to the power dynamics of the relationship.

"Most Republicans I know are in the second group, and for them it’s not exactly “their side”, it’s that “God tells me I have to vote for the pro-life candidate” (doesn’t matter if they aren’t, just being GOP is close enough), or a few wealthier ones that “2-issue” voters I’d say, that are “I don’t want to pay taxes and trump will keep them low” with a secondary “I have to vote GOP cause it’s God’s party”.

"Multiculturalism doesn't mean the absence of standards. It doesn't mean we have to accept propaganda that goes against the universal values we share as people living in a liberal democracy. It simply means people are free to enjoy their cultural heritage and free to culturally explore, whether or not they're ancestrally from our founding nations (English, French, Indigenous). Inoffensive things like tradition, dance, music, food. 

Multiculturalism doesn't even have to mean we're obliged to offer a Chinese cultural program in our schools. As a New Brunswicker Multiculturalist, I personally don't see the use for such a program, and especially not as it's funded by a dictatorship and obviously used for blackmail (penalty fees). I would rather see a place for international affairs &amp; cultures in our curriculum, which would be age appropriate and see historical and contemporary topics introduced. Political and cultural. But no focus on one foreign culture over the other. Certainly not government-funded propaganda. Your description of multiculturalism seems more like a version of extreme social libertarianism where cultural relativism is allowed to foster, and that's not how most multiculturalists view multiculturalism.

"We don't do it for the same reason Russia does it necessarily, we do it because that's how sovereignty works, and why societies in each country have a right to live the way they want, including how they handle issues of immigration.

It's the same issue with immigration.

US Immigration law, conversely, is the business of the US people and the US government.

"Here's the text.  Please highlight (use bold) where is ""clearly states"" that the power to resolve constitutional questions resides with the judiciary.  Before you attempt this exercise, please consider what Thomas Jefferson had to say on the matter:

* ""The question whether the judges are invested with exclusive authority to decide on the constitutionality of a law has been heretofore a subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties. Certainly there is not a word in the Constitution which has given that power to them more than to the Executive or Legislative branches.""   —Thomas Jefferson to W. H. Torrance, 1815. ME 14:303 

* ""The Constitution . . . meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each other. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres, would make the Judiciary a despotic branch.""   —Thomas Jefferson to Abigail Adams, 1804. ME 11:51 

* ""To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have with others the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their maxim is boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem [good justice is broad jurisdiction], and their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves.""   —Thomas Jefferson to William C. Jarvis, 1820. ME 15:277 

And now for the text of the Constitution.  Again, please highlight in bold your ""clearly state[d]"" text.

&gt; The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to controversies between two or more states;--between a state and citizens of another state;--between citizens of different states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.

&gt; In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.

&gt; The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.

"Do you remember a political study that came out a while ago that the news ran various stories from like “Americans are tired of PC culture” or “More Americans condemn racism”? What the news was doing was what they always do; extracting one observation from a complex study to generate a whole article. If you actually read the study itself though, what’s presented is pretty interesting. 

1) We’re wayyyy more united as a country than news media or sites like reddit would have you believe. With the vast majority of people identifying as a moderate of some form, either center, conservative or progressive. 

2) Those who identified as very conservative/far right were actually a pretty small number, but they were double the percentage of people who identified as far-left. 

So in a sense, the bread tube crowd and other leftists are right, the extreme right is a bigger threat than the far-left, due to comparatively higher numbers and some people people in positions of authority, coupled with the far-rights euphemistic word games, media manipulation, etc. Listen to Behind the Bastards’ three part podcast on George Lincoln Rockwell to see where all of that garbage comes from. 

However, that does not excuse the false dichotomy of the only real opposing ideology to Fascism being Socialism/Communism. That’s hogwash and the fact that people were trying to push that line of thinking while overlooking a history of red-brown alliances as well as the brutality of far-left states is what made me want to oppose both the rise of the new far-right in the US, and the propagation of far-left ideas as the only alternative to fascism. These populist fads are people looking for simple solutions to the complex problems of our country, thinking that if they could just implement their ideology, everything would be okay. 

To quote one of my favorite journalists, who was born and raised in the USSR but stands against Tankies and other forms of bloodthirsty leftism, while actually still being pretty left:

"I don't want to say, absolutely, but this is exactly how my GERD.  Felt like my heart would be giving out any second, sulfur burps, coughing a storm.

I found out I have GERD and that I had developed sensitivity to some acids.  Additionally have food allergies to chocolate, crab and lobster (but not shrimp), turkey, and some spices like parsley and cinnamon.  What was weird was that the allergy would inflame my tongue and cause Esophagitis causing acid to spill into my lungs.  Not the usual, turning into a big red puff ball.

I started watching what I eat and cut completely out the allergy foods.  Sulfur burps were the first thing to go away.  Every once and a while I get flare ups, especially if I've eaten a lot or something really fatty or oily.  But for the most part, changing my eating habits and staying away from the bad foods that trigger it has really made a world of difference.  I have to keep a food journal now to be on the watch for any new allergies I develop like olive oil is okay (I guess, I've never drank the stuff raw, but using it in cooking doesn't seem to upset anything), but pop a few actual olives in my mouth and a few minutes later I'll be feeling the burn.

Again, don't take this as any kind of diagnosis.  Also the food allergy testing wasn't that super expensive, but I also had an upper endoscopy done which came with quite the price tag.  Also, it was a pain to get scheduled.  Some days they were suggesting the anesthesiologist wasn't in network, some days the guy who does the endoscope (sorry they told what the name of that was, but I don't remember) wasn't in network, some days the techs weren't in network.  Took about ten or eleven calls to finally get a date three months down the road where everyone in the room would be in network.  Even then the final cost was around $2500.  I had an FSA which gives you all the money up front, was pretty much the only saving grace.",tensor(1)
"&gt; but what point is there to vaccine if seemingly it is doing nothing?

Your anecdotal experience is horrific and I'm not discounting it, but it does not represent the average anecdotal experience.  Data clearly demonstrates that remaining unvaccinated means you have a DRASTICALLY higher chance of dying to COVID, regardless of underlying health conditions.

&gt; How can data be trusted that has had less than a year to be compiled?

You do the best you can with data you have.  The longer we have to collect data and the more data we have to collect, the stronger the conclusions we can draw.

Almost 200,000,000 people, nearly 1 in 3, has had at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.  The rate of vaccination started slowing down a bit about 2 months ago.  That's a shit load of data.  We look at who shows up in hospitals.  We look at their vaccination history.  We look at their blood pressure and body fat percentage and whether they smoke and their race and age and do this huge multi-factor analysis.  Then we draw conclusions:

* ""At risk"" means high probability of developing viral pneumonia which can lead to scarring of the lungs and permanent drop in lung function (I have this) and immediate danger of death
* Older people are at risk
* Smoking makes you at risk
* Any heart disease at risk
* There are a whole host of other health issues that make you at risk (and asthma, puzzlingly, is not one of them)
* Being vaccinated with any of the COVID vaccines cuts your post-infection risk by 97.3% 97.75% regardless of confounding factors

These conclusions are only better-supported as time goes on.

If you need anecdotal stories, there are dozens of ""shit I deal with"" stories from nurses on basically every video platform.  One of my favorite graphs is [this one](https://preview.redd.it/h5hax33dplg71.png?auto=webp&amp;s=a1afdb8e8f58e55b60f92bb1cc6eca493b3f2836) (the bottom one) which charts COVID hospitalizations against vaccination rate by state.

"I dunno. It seems we have roughly the same focus as we've always had on it in my forty-ish years, and in most ways where it's increased it seems generally warranted. 

And it seems, much like this example given here, to barely ever even dream to scratch the bottom of the top 100 issues that might be pressing and needing our focus currently, in my estimation.

"&gt;I do believe that clip first clip you reference has been debunked as modified, but, alas, I do not have a source.

It hasn't. You can see the same thing in the full hour-long video of Bernie's comments a well as the specific clip that's floating around. In the full context, which takes a while to find, you can see that he's saying bread lines are a good thing because in some other places the rich have all the food and the poor starve to death. That's still not a very good point, because ideally one would prefer with a system that prevents food scarcity altogether, and bread lines are no so much ""a good thing"" as ""a slightly less bad thing"" than mass starvation. Nevertheless, the merits of Bernie's comments are irrelevant -- my point is how they will play in attack ads.

&gt;The problem for your research is that everything I clicked on I saw months ago from other sources. 

Yes, it's not secret to us political junkies, although there's probably quite a bit that we still haven't seen. It was very poorly known as recently as 2016, when I supported Bernie over Clinton, although I would have preferred a candidate like Pete at the time if given the choice. Despite following politics closely, I didn't know about these major electability hurdles. Knowing what I know now, I think he would have lost even worse than Clinton.

&gt;All of the other campaigns know this stuff and probably find it as unimpressive as I do. If they thought there was ammunition it would have been used long before now.

That's because the attacks don't make sense to use within the Democratic primary. Candidates want to become President, not just the nominee, and launching attacks seen as too unfair or right-wing against Bernie would cost them lots of votes in November while winning very few right now. 

Also, there's already a moderate majority opposed to Bernie, so it makes more sense for the moderates to fight to become the consensus alternative than to try to eat into Bernie's fervent but limited support. 

Likewise, Republicans aren't hitting Bernie with the hard stuff because they want him to become the nominee so they can run against him.

&gt;Man wouldn’t you hate to be a politician and have every single sentence you’ve ever uttered be fodder for disgruntled people to pick apart, twist and take out of context. Not something I would choose to do for a living.

"Partially.  I'm an older American (by Reddit's standards, anyway), and the slogan does appeal to me, although Trump doesn't at all.  It's hard to describe to young people, but I can remember an America that was ""greater"" than what most of you younger Redditors have ever known.  I can also remember it worse than you've probably ever known.  If you think it's unusual that Trump has as much momentum as he does, let me assure you that it's nothing compared to if had the chance to run in 1979.  Trump's slogan is an idea that appeals to my generation in a big way mostly because we all can remember times when we were ""greater"" in many ways and can transpose that idea onto the notion of a Trump presidency.  A few, like me, think that it'll never actually happen and that Trump has no idea just how much he'd be blunted by a Congress that loathes him.  But, many in my generation will hear that slogan and project their best memories forward onto Trump.  So, yes, I think it's probably geared towards older Americans to a certain degree, although I'm not sure it's intentional.  I think Trump is probably doing the same thing, remember a better time and believing he can make it that way again.  I think the slogan is more just him being a ""typical"" older American.",tensor(0)

They were comparing it to the -1.9% from the GFC so it is significent but it is not the 8%-10% that was predicted earlier in the crisis and is predicated on staying at Level 1( where we are now). So yes, that is a hugely deep recession for New Zealand but in comparision to other countries who are indeed around that -10% range AND still dealing with an ongoing crisis the response has been excellent. I not trying to claim it was the best just that it could have been worse. It was not heavy handed and our current situation shows that. I'm happy for WA and ACT but there was a lot of risk attatched to their response back in Feb/Mar. Other countries that are still struggling can attest to that. To be fair, NZ has the worst ICU bed capacity in the OECD and that fact was a contributing factor in the response.

"The clause in question comes from the [Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States Approved March 1, 1845](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/annexation/march1845.html)

The relevant bit of text:

&gt;Third -- New States of convenient size not exceeding four in number, in addition to said State of Texas and having sufficient population, may, hereafter by the consent of said State, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled to admission under the provisions of the Federal Constitution; and such states as may be formed out of the territory lying south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly known as the Missouri Compromise Line, shall be admitted into the Union, with or without slavery, as the people of each State, asking admission shall desire; and in such State or States as shall be formed out of said territory, north of said Missouri Compromise Line, slavery, or involuntary servitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.

Which, for clarity, we can reduce to:

&gt;New States not exceeding four in number, in addition to said State of Texas may, hereafter by the consent of said State, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled to admission under the provisions of the Federal Constitution;

This here, seems to be super clear, Texas at is some discretion can simply carve itself up into five states, right?

No. It cannot.

No serious legal scholar believes that clause to be valid. Rather, the commonly accepted understanding among *serious constitutional scholars* is that Texas has the option to *enter the Union* as as many as five states.

Now, why can Texas not carve itself up anytime it wants when the plain language of the joint resolution says it can?

* The Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States is superceded by the [Joint Resolution for the admission of the state of Texas into the Union, J.Res. 1, enacted December 29, 1845](https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/9/STATUTE-9-Pg108a.pdf) (Warning: PDF, sorry) which states:

&gt;the State of Texas shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever.

Which means Texas is no different than any other state. Other states cannot self-divide on a whim. If Texas could, it would no longer be on equal footing with other states.

* *Even if* the annexation language said something to the effect of: ""The State of Texas may at its sole discretion at any time in the future create up to four additional states within its borders and those states will be grated statehood."" It would fail for multiple reasons.
   * One Congress cannot bind another  
For instance one Congress could not pass a law requiring future a future Congress to only pass balanced budgets. Likewise, one Congress cannot approve a state for admission to the Union on behalf of a future one.
   * Congress cannot admit a theoretical state which does not yet exist.
   * Once the *Republic of Texas* became the *State of Texas* it and its people were beholden to the US Constitution which says:  
New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.

&gt;The Fraser Institute has published material skeptical of climate change science since at least 2001, which marks the publication of Global Warming: A Guide to the Science by Willie Soon and Sallie L. Baliunas The abstract states: ""There is no clear evidence, nor unique attribution, of the global effects of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. Meaningful assessments of the environmental impacts of anthropogenic CO2 are not yet possible because model estimates of global and regional changes in climate on interannual, decadal and centennial time-scales remain highly uncertain."" [21]

&gt;The Fraser Institute published an Independent Summary for Policymakers [22] (ISPM) on Feb. 5, 2007, which was released after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report on Climate Change. [23] Economist and Fraser Institute Senior Fellow Ross McKitrick served as co-ordinator of the ISPM [1]. Desmogblog leaked a late draft of the Fraser Institute ISPM in the runup to the IPCC official release [2]. In 2003, Professor Ross McKitrick is known for his opposition to the Endangered Species Act in Canada, and is the author of Taken By Storm, which denies climate change. McKitrick is also a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute.

&gt;Kenneth Green held the positions of Chief Scientist and Director of Centre for Studies in Risk, Regulation, and Environment at the Fraser Institute from 2002 to 2005. While at the Institute, Kenneth Green published many anti-Kyoto and climate change skeptical articles, notably ""The Science Isn't Settled: The limitations of climate change models"" [24] together with Tim Ball and Steven Schroeder. As reported in the Huffington Post, ""The Fraser Institute received $120,000 from ExxonMobil in 2003-‘04. Fraser Institute Foundation President Michael Walker said the funding paid for the work of researcher Kenneth Green, who served as chief scientist at Fraser Institute between 2002-2005."" [25]

Personally, I'm much more interested in human health and well being than partisan politics. But science denialism hurts all of us. And warrants real criticism and pushback.

This is true for the people who falsely claimed that smoking was safe in the 80s and 90s, and it's true for the people who are causing outbreaks of preventable diseases by pushing misinformation about vaccines today.

The fact is the dogma currently accepted by progressive university professors and progressive students is *just one* viewpoint. I might even agree with it, but it is not above questioning.

If the professor had simply said ""don't show any material I haven't set out"" that would be fine. She is an employee after all.

That's not what happened. He crime was not that she showed an unvetted or contraversial video. Her supposed crime was that she didn't denounce Peterson before showing it. She wasn't even trying to push Peterson's view. She got in trouble for not being vocally against it. And then they accused her of being transphobic.

Like holy shit. I know people complain about progressive indoctrination in universities. I always dismissed it, being progressive myself. But the university is seriously telling the TA that she needs to tell students what to think. Maybe I never noticed it because there's less opportunity for indoctrination in STEM classes?

Illegal immigration also depresses wages for the poorest income levels across our country. $5.7 billion for a wall across about 200+ miles easily pays itself off and some in reduced border crossings, reduced crime, reduced wage depression, etc. You can easily make that same ecological argument against new development of businesses, homes, schools, hospitals, etc. but we still have to live, learn, get treated somewhere and conduct business.

"&gt; The problem is that all the rest of your talking points about spreading around risk and it working correctly for that is almost entirely incorrect

No, that's literally what insurance does. It's the definition and it's even discussed in the M4A bill.

&gt;The vast majority if people in America do not quse their health insurance, or skip out on preventative healthcare, due to the unforeseen costs, confusing levels of coverage, and ""surprise"" costs that come up during care.

This is demonstrably false. There are some Americans in that situation, but most Americans (92%, in fact) are insured and use their health insurance regularly. There are Americans in the situation that they avoid using it because of costs (and we should protect them), but they are not in the majority.

&gt;Let's use a personal example. I pay 1k/month for health insurance for my wife and I. I am lucky and have a $0 deductible plan so I can get preventative healthcare for the cost of a copay. However, if I ever need to go to an emergency room its $300 our of my pocket to show up and then I pay 20% of the bill. My only other options through my employer was a $2k deductible plan where all costs were out of pocket for me until I paid that much and then I pay 10% of any bill from then forward (I save $1k over a year on this plan) or a $10k deductible plan (I save $2k over a year) where I pay that much and then nothing else afterwards.

Polling indicates that Americans like being able to pick the amount of coverage they have based on their risk tolerance.

&gt;This is needlessly complicated.

CPU design is complicated as well - that doesn't mean it's a failing industry.

&gt;The system is predatory to the consumer. This is the only reason the industry is booming.

I think you'll have a lot of trouble proving that and you're definitely going to have a hell of a time selling it to the American voter.

&gt;As for jobs, I always like to talk about Medicare for all in the same breath as a universal income as it solves a lot of problems.

Only if voters support it.

&gt;Depending on the medicare for all plan we go with it's possible the nation saves a TON of money that could be used for a universal income program, or even an unemployed income to help people we can not find work that is more comprehensive than our current plan.

I think you're confused. You seem to be equating universal healthcare with M4A and they're not at all the same thing. M4A is a single payer plan - it's the name of a bill. M4A is a particularly ambitious universal healthcare plan that forcibly shuts down private insurance companies and replaces them with the government. It's one of the most extreme universal healthcare plans on earth and represents a much more socialist plan than even Scandanavian countries offer.

&gt;Overall, medicare for all is a conversation that really brings to light the differing options of trickle up vs trickle down economics. 

Honestly, the most interesting part of this is how many fervent supporters don't actually realize what M4A is or means. It directly mirrors the polling done on the subject, which is that the American populace generally supports universal healthcare, but does not support single payer healthcare. More specifically, if you say ""Medicare for All!"" they respond positively, but if you talk about the policy it represents support drops through the floor.

It actually sounds to me that you are not quite as staunch an M4A supporter as you think you are.",tensor(1)

"&gt; These are all studies based on legal immigrants,

I think at least one of them went into benefits to giving illegal immigrants legal status, but I'm too lazy to check right now. I definitely agree that they don't prove anything about completely unrestricted immigration.

&gt; It massively increases supply without any more increase for demand so it drives wages down.

I disagree here, immigrants do increase demand for jobs because they still buy food, clothes, idk all sorts of stuff. Their role in the market is that of a consumer, just like you or I. 

I think the only negative economic impact I've seen from immigration is that it has a slightly negative effect on other immigrant salaries, since immigrants are typically competing for a far smaller field of jobs than US citizens. I would say generally the benefits outweigh the costs.

"I'm getting a hint that Trump has certain information given to him from sources and even before his Presidential Candidacy in June 2015, and he wants to convey the truth to Americans as directly as he can without being arrested himself. How to do this? Just outright accuse your opponent of something, using as much publicly available information as possible.

Make no mistake about Trump's knowledge of foreign affairs. He knows much more than what he can tell the public, and often...like this case of accusing Obama and Hillary of ISIS creation...he comes off sounding like a lunatic.

There's a reason why.

It's because he speaks the truth, and many don't know what to do with it when it falls on their laps with such a solid THUD.

And since our political opponents like to split hairs, let's do it as well. A founder is much different than a LEADER. We've had many ISIS leaders. A founder, is somebody like George Soros, who lies in the shadows, and supports organizations they believe will further their mission. 

It's a common phrase and I'm sure people have said this many times, but money knows no political or religious boundary when you are established and so high up in government. Most people, who end up at such level, do not see things like you or I do. They don't see things as Democrat or Republican. Christian or otherwise. If it can make them richer, they'll do it. There are no boundaries. There are no morals.

As far as the Bush family supporting Islamic Extremism, all I can say is the Bush Administration was in bed with Saudi Arabia as much as Hillary was, and it is no surprise they would support Saudi interests. 

This is another reason why Trump is not popular within Republican ranks. The Saudi Connection. And this is probably the biggest reason. This is big money here. The Saudis have infiltrated the US, and let's face it, how many US employees are in Saudi Arabia any given day? Maybe around 100,000? That's just civilian and private companies.

Saudi Arabia has been connected to terrorist attacks on US soil, even before 9/11. But it came to a head with 9/11, and unfortunately, the Bush Administration gave the Saudi Government a pass. That really pissed me off.

Especially with the a Saudi rep coming to New York (I think it was the Saudi Prince at the time), having the camel balls to say he is sorry, but then telling Americans that we deserved it (paraphrasing here but what he implied, was that the US deserved 9/11 in the same breath of his ""sorry"" statement). Anyone remember this? I was so mad.

Except the left is the one trying to oppress and threaten your right to own a firearm. Is it any wonder that organizations that are threatened by one half of the political parties in the USA, go out of their way to ""Support"" and stroke the ego of the party that supports their right to exist?

I mean, do you really think these gun organizations are all gay hating, bible thumpers? Or is it a thousand times more likely that they merely support the groups that are most likely to allow their continued existence?

Likewise, does Reddit (et al) really believe in progressive ideals, or are they more likely pandering to their target demographic?

I'm not saying ""you're stupid, go die in a fire."" But if I were to buy a gun, it would be based on it's performance and ability to protect my family. No criminal is going to avoid breaking into my house because I choose a ""progressive"" gun manufacturer. 

Moreover, do you check whether Pepsi values your political beliefs before you grab a soda? What about condoms? What about medicine? Surely, you don't want to support the same corporations that also benefit from drug dealing doctors ""legally"" getting families addicted to opiates... except that's all of them... you still take medicine, right? 

If you really want to support an organization that betters our lives. Buy a good gun, and then donate to the EFF, or buy some games on GOG (Good Old Games). The EFF is like the ACLU except they actually still believe in protecting our civil liberties. And GOG is a web store that repackages good old games and sells them DRM-free. As in, ""you own this game forever. No tracking. No bullshit."" So whenever I can, I support them creating a ""better world"" for gamers. They also often bundle music (many times in FLAC format if available), developer diaries, and other neat stuff free of charge. (Game manuals too.) They have tons of sales too. Also, on Humble Bundle (which donates ~10% to charity), you can choose a charity of your choice and even the proportion of money that goes to charities vs developers vs humble-bundle. I choose 100% to charity, and send it to the EFF.

"You are correct, we (the public) haven't been able to see the intelligence agencies official report on this. However, I have a question for you? Given the fact that every person who has seen the report or been briefed on it, including GOP congressmen, have all agreed that it the hacks were done by Russia. Only one person disagrees with everyone, and that person is Trump. 

The report hasn't been made public, but you have every single intelligence agency, congress, and even Trump supporters all agreeing that Russia is behind this. The only person who says otherwise, and who has provided no such evidence (despite claiming he would) is Trump. 

Trump has avoided intelligence briefings, and even stated that his sources now include Julian Assange (someone he said should have been executed). 

So I agree with you that the public hasn't seen any concrete evidence. But for all of those who have (including his own party), the intelligence agencies evidence is enough to convince them that Russia is behind this. Trump is the sole detractor, and hasn't provided any counter evidence beyond claiming it was a 400 pound teenager (mind you, he also asked Russia to hack HRC during the election lol). 

Trump has not only disagreed with the entire intelligence community, but he has made it painfully obvious that he wouldn't even entertain the possibility that it was Russia. 

Let's also look back at the simple connections between Trump and Russia (while these don't prove guilt, they do show a hidden influence). Trump has previously denied knowing Putin, while being recorded in the past acknowledging he has met Putin. He has done nothing but compliment Putin. He has hidden business connections that are heavily invested in Russia. He is debt to Russian businessmen. His SoS nominee received the highest award Russia gives to a foreign person, and who also has business relationships with Putin. He even went so far as to attack everyone who disagrees with him and instead praise Putin, calling him smart.

I'm sorry, but those who deny even the possibility that Russia was involved (including Trump), are not capable of logical/critical thinking. The fact is that everyone who has seen the evidence all agree that Russia is responsible. It's not a liberal/left wing conspiracy as his own party is against him. It's the US government vs Trump. To dispute even the remote chance is insane. Trump claims to have evidence that no one else does. He also claimed he would reveal it, which he hasn't done yet. This isn't going to court, so innocent until proven guilty doesn't apply. If anything, this would apply more in a civil court setting where there doesn't need to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 

Again, to just view the general argument here, it's neither side has publicly released their proof. But everyone who has seen the US's proof agrees that Russia is behind this (except Trump) and Trump's evidence is only known by him and his anonymous sources. 

Trump has revealed his own bias by not even entertaining the possibility that Russia is behind it. He has done nothing but state Russia's innocence. He is 100% certain they are innocent, when 99% of the US government is certain they are guilty. 

Answer me honestly, do you truly believe Trump (and apparently his son) are smarter than the entire US intelligence community and the US congress? If you do, then there is no point in debating this, you will not accept anything I state nor ever back down from your view. You are incapable of admitting you are even possibly wrong (just like Trump, he believes he is God and is infallible). 

I'm done debating this online as most aren't open to opposing views. I'll entertain the fact that there is a chance that Russia is innocent. But until Trump provides his evidence, and the entire US government changes their tune, I'll agree that Russia ""is most likely"" behind the hacks. ",tensor(0)

"&gt; But also its things like Greg Doucette's twitter chain
&gt;  (now at 700+
&gt; ) highlighting police brutality, and total disregard for basic decency. 

Right.  I made the point, I believe it was over at SSC, that what is unique about 2020 vs previous police protests is that Americans showed their disapproval of the riots *and* the police by becoming more sympathetic to BLM.  Because for the first time in their lives, they are seeing *hours upon hours* of footage of *the police rioting.*   The average American saw footage of rioters, except the saw the police as part of the riots, to some extent.  ""Law and Order"" was no longer a credible rallying cry when the police themselves were out of order.

&gt;(perhaps not uncommon for a New Yorker) and you had said something like ""Yeah I got a problem chief, you almost ran me over asshole, what the fuck?""

I mean, in the fantasies of my mind I told the doughboy police officer to put down his piece and throw down if he wants to throw down.  Of course, what came out of my mouth was a croaking ""no sir.""  I'm not sure at least part of that was driven by the fact that I was walking with my wife.

The interesting part was that the police officer had no problem instigating shit in public.  This is New York City, and though we weren't on Fifth Ave, pretty much every intersection has at least three or four people witnessing.

When I retell the story, I insist that it isn't an experience that changed my mind on police officers.

"Clearly you’re not familiar with the healthcare system. When you’ve worked in the field and seen the costs of socialist healthcare, you may be singing a different tune. It’s out of control. 

For example, thinking of just one specific individual I’ve had dealings with, this person visits the city ERs about 10x per week. Sometimes multiple ERs in a single day. This person is 50 and has been visiting the ER like this since the mid-90s. In fact, not only are they visiting the ER this frequently for the past 25 years, they’ve also forced the hospitals to dip into deeper services to make customized care plans for them because they’re out-of-control many times. 

Do you know what the cost of *just getting triaged* in a Canadian ER is? Your taxes in a single year wouldn’t pay this person’s weekly ER visits’ bill.


In another separate case, the cost (at least 6-7 years ago when this came as a topic) for an in-patient psychiatric bed in Southern Ontario is about $2,000+ per day. If they need direct 1:1 monitoring (which many at my facility do), that’s another $500-$700 per day. And this individual under watch for the past *three years* has cost the system over $2 Million, when you factor in non-psychiatric hospitalization needs as well. And that’s a generous estimate. The cost is likely higher. I can surely tell you this individual has not worked that entire time, and are paying no taxes on the care they’re using. 

Even if they did work, they could work for centuries and not pay off the usage they’ve usurped. And this person is 22y/o.

&gt;  
&gt;“And let me say tonight, that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,” he told a raucous New Hampshire crowd after his victory was announced. “With victories behind us, popular vote in Iowa, and the victory here tonight, we’re going to Nevada, we’re going to South Carolina, we’re going to win those states as well.” 

Bernie is showing he is not afraid of Trump and this campaign isn't just about enacting new policy it's also about ending the reign of a corrupt tyrant.

"She was not 'forced' to do anything. She applied for asylum and was put on a list and told it could take a few months to be processed. She got impatient after a few weeks and crossed illegally. 

Edit: Just to add, I'm not arguing that seeking asylum is illegal. I just believe that the proper steps should be taken when trying to enter this country. I understand that per the current laws, someone can cross the border illegally and THEN claim asylum. In my own opinion, I believe that to be flawed and I think it needs to be changed. 

As far as the processing centers themselves, and the conditions that people are being held in, I really think that it comes down to logistics. Many of these centers are becoming out of date, over-crowded and under-funded. 

As someone with views on the left and the right, I think that there hase to be some kind of compromise that both sides can agree on that increases our border security, improves the conditions and efficiency of the processing centers, encourages entry through the proper points of entry and discourages the dangerous crossings in the desert.

"&gt;I have over 500 channels now with at least 20 of them dedicated to news and politics. Why would the fairness doctrine be needed now?

I think this era of Choose Your Own Reality is a problem. The better technology companies are at matching advertisements with content tailored to your interests (aka fears, anxieties, outrage, validation), the worse off we are as an informed electorate. I see this as one type of money-in-politics problem.

&gt;As far as banning political ads, don’t you feel that simply would benefit incumbents?

""Simply""? No. I think it may benefit incumbents, simply because incumbents are generally favored in elections, and this will remove some of the churn that might disfavor them, but at the same time I think political ads are just vehicles for disinformation lately. You can pretty much say whatever lies you want and it's protected as speech. Businesses can't even get away with that.

Maybe I would settle for some sort of law that says you can't have a demonstrably false statement in a political ad? I don't know if that's better or worse than just banning them outright in terms of abuse potential for our first amendment protections.  But if it's a similar legal standard to how Giuliani got disbarred, I think you can do it effectively without it running amok.

I'm not going to champion either of these suggestions particularly hard, because I do understand and respect the implications that come attached with them.

"Mr Speaker,  
It will come as no surprise to colleagues and friends that on the whole I am not supportive of this Queen’s Speech (QS). We have seen the PWP who up until recently maintained the position that they could rein in the more radical parts of Solidarity and whatever husk is left of the Labour Party.   
I have deep reservations about this QS and where it will take the United Kingdom. I believe that over this term there will be avenues for the Official Opposition to work with the government, but we should be in no doubt that with what is effectively a small majority, there will be revelations over the time that may surprise everyone.   
The government tells us now that they want to implement a new wealth tax on net assets over £1,000,000 with a half rate applied for those placed in investments. So, to this end, the government doesn’t want to see investment in companies, the process of buying shares in companies is that you are investing in the business and you will get equity in return. This policy will make individuals and others think about where they invest.   
My right honourable friend u/model-willem, has rightly picked up on the new rules for Value Added Tax. The creation of a new rate of 35% for luxury goods will mean that people will stop visiting shops like Harrods or other luxury goods avenues across the capital and the UK. These shops and industries employ thousands of people and the government wants to price the UK out. When you can simply get on a train and visit mainland Europe for cheaper goods.   
Whilst I support the VAT being set as zero for sanitary products, I believe this was previously achieved under a Conservative-led government.   
Next, the government says that they want to introduce minimum pricing measures on alcohol, but exempting pubs from it. So not only has the government increased beer duty in the last budget as a way to protect “against alcohol abuse”, it wants to nationalise pubs.  
Where is this money coming from? Why are we taking these pubs into public ownership when if they were so vital, they would survive anyway?  
If we look at an example of the last time this was done, in 1916, during the first world war. What happened? You ended up paying more for less. Why was this? The alcohol content of the drink on sale was reduced and the prices were increased. What incentives do these civil servants have in increasing profits? They simply won’t.   
It comes as no surprise the government is looking at policies from the early 20th century.   
As we move further down the speech we see the government wants to introduce a new model for ownership in workplaces. Whilst employees want the ability to help determine the direction of their workplace, why is it needed to create large scale ownership by the workers? It is not an appropriate way to run a business.   
This is the same as providing bailouts and interventions for companies. The question I have is, why are we writing a blank cheque for businesses who failed? This is not an efficient way to run an economy. We need to objectively evaluate whether these businesses are really worth saving when there are generally reasons why they have failed.   
On the issue of working to ensure that there is “public confidence in policing”, we see no mention of the 20,000 police officers that were being funded. Where are we with hiring more policemen and women? In the very same breath they want to give local authorities the responsibilities of the Police and Crime Commissioners. I struggle to see how this is helpful when you need an appointed role to deal with this. There are better methods to deal with accountability in the Police force, but this is certainly not it.   
Mr Speaker, interestingly when I review the QS, I find that there is a national water strategy to strengthen infrastructure? So what infrastructure? How much is going to be spent? How will the flooding zones be prioritised? If you take this at face value, this seems reasonable. Who doesn’t want investment in this area?   
The real issue is that we don’t quite know what exactly this is and how this will be carried out. This is another issue with this government that they seemingly give everything a blank cheque. I fear that those colleagues who are budget disciplinarians, may lose the fight again and again.   
As we go further down the QS, we end up with an assortment of nationalisations, blank cheques and platitudes. This government’s program for as long as it is, is unbelievable and risible.",tensor(0)

And yet, for all the rhetoric, immigration reached its height while May was at the Home Office, seeing huge increases even from outside the EU where we have more control.

It's also like Sajid Javid's recent intervention with regards Shamima Begum. The fact of the matter she was born in this country and has British citizenship. We ought to take her back and punish her according to our laws. But Javid would rather make a big show and virtue signal just how right wing he can be, all the while doing very little to deal seriously with wider security concerns.

The issue of free speech is neither here nor there (trying to curb what are essentially terrorist groups from marching in the streets is not a free speech issue).

And we need to not just pay attention to electoral fraud ... It's well known and accepted that GOP has also been working on voter suppression, putting voting machines in dem areas that are prone to spoilage,  canceling voter registrations based on [""like sounding names"" (where most of the names were black or hispanic)](http://www.gregpalast.com/floridas-disappeared-voters-disfranchised-by-the-gop/) and requiring picture IDs then [closing DMVs primarily in areas that poll well for Dems](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/disturbing-racial-pattern-in-alabama-closings-537741891606)

"Dude you have to realize that most of those deaths are from people who were on the verge of death anyway. They were either people in nursing home where the average person only lives a few months anyway, or obese people with heart issues. Those aren't corona deaths, those are old age and obesity deaths.

The actual death count of people who weren't about to die anyway is probably a 100th of that. Also spread out over the entire planet it's almost nothing. I only know of one person who died in my country. I know there's more but it's hardly even noticeable.

Finally, the stock market is at an ATH. Yes, some businesses are hurting, but we're gonna be fine. Things could be so much worse.",tensor(1)
"Do you mind elaborating on what you find more appealing about O'Toole over Harper and (especially) Ambrose? 

I definitely don't find myself in the Conservative camp these days and there's quite a bit about the last couple years of Harper's tenure that I didn't like, but I feel he's a more appealing leader than O'Toole. Of course, he had the opportunity to actually lead so we have more to go off there. Ambrose only got the interim leader intro for us but I feel like had she actually gotten the leadership role she could have been real trouble for Trudeau and the Liberals. She's smart, pretty quick on her feet, well respected in her party, likely could've helped court some women voters, is a bit more progressive so could appeal to centrists a bit more, etc. I guess, thinking about it, the biggest thing is that Harper had a strangle hold for the most part with the more fringe sectors of the party and , for whatever reason,  I just feel Ambrose could have been pretty good at that too?",tensor(0)
"I disagree with a lot of her politics, but I think she got absolutely fucked over by her party. She got called a secret Republican, a Russian asset, and all sorts of things, just because she’s anti-war, and because she exposed the darling of the Party, Kamala, for her authoritarian past.

She was my favorite Democrat in the primary after Yang",tensor(0)
Anyone who watched China stock market collapse as the corona virus spread would only assume that if it made it to America the same would happen here. Question I ask at what point does the SEC determine that someone made a better judgement call versus having pre-hand knowledge that it is making its way here and these would be the effects from it? I stocked up on supplies weeks before the first confirmed case in America cause I knew it was going to make its way here one way or the other. Seems smart of me to be presumptuous versus waiting for it to hit to start buying supplies.,tensor(1)
Yep sometimes I do for sure. I think it would be nice to be one of those quasi christians who believe in god but don’t go along with the doctrine but I can’t force myself to believe things that probably aren’t true. I also don’t believe in free will so the universe feels quite hostile to me although there may be some positives if can figure out the whole “no self” thing but I haven’t grasped it yet unfortunately,tensor(1)

"&gt; I just got called dumb by a guy who writes long rants about how mad he is that minority comic book characters exist. 

See the funny thing is I have actually never actually written anything like this. I've written about how I think marvel does their newer characters a disservice by trying to replace older characters and often does a worse job bringing minority characters into their lineup than DC. If you actually you know, read what I have written and comprehend you would realize that I have specifically celebrated how minorities have been treated in DC comics where they are written as complete characters with traits beyond their minority status, but how marvel struggles with that. So at least you proved my point. Dumb, dishonest, or both!",tensor(1)

"It just concerns me that these things are not being studied. I personally feel that the people in power in this country don't really want an educated populous. In many states education has been ruined by lack of funding and for profit charter schools. My beef against charter schools is they don't have a local school board, they have a board alright, and its goal is to make as much profit as possible. In the long haul, education suffers.

I was totally unaware things were being watered down at the college level too. Frankly, I am disturbed. Without knowledge, it is easy for politicians, large corporations, banks and other powerful entities to overtake the will of the people for their own financial gain.",tensor(0)
"We actually ended up getting into a discussion shortly after he admitted his regret for Trump. During the discussion he asked me more about my political opinion and why I vote the way I do. After I explained my side, I told him that I originally liked Bernie and of course broke down his platform to my Uncle. He liked a lot of the things he heard and felt that the next time around he would be more inclined to vote for a candidate with these ideas. He also admits that he also voted for Trump because he didn’t want the standard politician in office. Bernie actually fits his interests quite nice. ",tensor(1)

"Never said I was happy with Congress and trust me I know very well how inadequately the VA is funded. Battlefield medicine is amazing in today's armed forces, I doubt I would be alive if I had been in the Vietnam era. Sorry, but I spent six months in various hospitals and rehab and I consider myself lucky only to be paralyzed, compared to other injured vets I have met. 20 years of war has left the VA overloaded with physically and mentally wounded vets.

"What I've started doing, is, at least in my own life, calling these people on their shit point blank. I saw a guy I know on Facebook, big Bernie Bro type, who has historically shown great respect for me, saying things like ""all conservatives are nazis and fascists"", so I point blank said, ""Maybe you didn't know this before but I am a conservative. I am right wing. I am a Trump supporter. 95%+ of my family are right wing. Are WE nazi fascists?"" 

Don't let them get away with this shit and let your own reputation and character be your proof against it wherever you can. Be as ""based"" as you can manage. (Based means being yourself and living according to your beliefs btw...seems like everyone uses it to mean ""conservative"" which is false.)

I live around urban liberals and have somehow earned a kind of ridiculous rep among them for being some sort of stoic, glaring Ron Swanson character, just by virtue of being *relatively* self-sufficient and into a few masculine hobbies. Everyone calls on me to help them fix things, or get advice, etc, because they're nearly all basically these helpless ""indoor cat"" type city people where I am largely reliable, outdoorsy, handy, etc and was raised by a real man. I'm also a military vet, a CCW holder, fly a flag outside my house, the whole nine yards, and I will *run* to help my neighbors when they need it. I run all the finances in my household, am married to a *quality* woman, own a beautiful home and give energy and money to charity wherever the need arises. Yet somehow, I'm a nazi, a fascist, a racist (huh, tell tell that to my friend group, who are largely immigrants and a cross section of people of all stripes.) Bullshit, I'm an average, anonymous, regular American citizen and I believe in the concepts of equality, merit, self-sufficiency. The nobility of a strong middle class. Benjamin Franklin type shit. 

Point being, it's one thing for internet leftists to make idiotic proclamations like this. It's another to openly *identify* yourself as both their boogeyman *and* somehow someone who possesses far more character, ability, community involvement and skin in the game than they do and let them fight out the cognitive dissonance in their head. Live your life *well* and set an example that makes their most rabid, bigoted attacks embarrass them even as the words come out of their mouths. ",tensor(1)

I went through four years of college while my partner spent 2 years in a trade program. He know makes well over 3x what I make annually and took on absolutely no debt whatsoever. 

I think the push for college was with good intentions because back in the day, tradesmen were a dime a dozen and held less potential for people. Education wasn’t as prevalent.

[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944327/) is a decent overview of the clinical development process in vaccines. Keep in mind that this is just the clinical part - this comes AFTER 7-10 years of laboratory research and development involving many thousands of animal trials - you have to have preliminary safety data in animals before you can even think about human trials. The point of the FDA approval process is to demonstrate safety and efficacy, so by the time they hit market both have been largely demonstrated. Obviously, decades-long studies aren't practical, so Stage IV ongoing evaluations are conducted after a vaccine has been approved for market. VAERS (the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System) is used for doctors to report temporally connected symptoms in relation to vaccine administration, and can be mined for statistics to follow up with actual research. The CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink provides a more reliable reporting system, in terms of participation. It's notable that vaccines are almost never withdrawn from the market for reasons related to danger - RotaShield is the only one I'm aware of, and that was almost 20 years ago.

It's true that pharmaceutical companies have tried (and still try) to market unsafe drugs, but the FDA is great about preventing that.

The lack of economic understanding by those on the left means they fail to realize that a minimum wage of $19/hr isn't the only amount an employer has to pay for an employee. There are also training costs, unemployment insurance, taxes (such as the employer portion of FICA), and other benefits or government imposed obligations. I know for example with myself, my ""total compensation"" is somewhere near double what I actually receive in wages at my job. 

When it will cost an employer, let's say 25% more than the base wage, to hire an employee, train them, and cover whatever other obligations they have as an employer, that works out to about 23.75/hr, assume a 30 hour work week (so that the employer doesn't have to offer health insurance and the employee can just go with the state exchange under the ACA) and that works out to $37,050 per year per employee.

A friend of mine moved to Trump country a few years back. We texted, sometimes he would visit and sleep at my place. We'd been friends since middle-school. Then one day he just started drunk texting me evil shit. Just absolutely hate filled vile shit about how terrible of a person I am, how he could kill me with the skills he learned in the Army, shit about my girlfriend and parents (who were always nice to him). He would go into detail about how he could shoot me through the window I work next to at night, calling my little old dad all sorts of gay slurs. He would occasionally dropping n-bombs, and say shit about Jews running the world, but most of it was hatred directed at me and as personal as he could get.

It came out of nowhere, and I didn't know how to respond, so I just ignored him. Eventually he got around to talking points about how liberals like me ruined the country and think we're better than people like him. The weirdest thing is I had no idea he was a Trump supporter, and he moved away before Trump even won the primary so I literally never mentioned Trump to him. He went quiet for months, then started texting me as if nothing happened. That would be fine for a week or two, then would get drunk and angry and do it again. After the third time I just blocked him for good. Every time it would get back to Trump related shit and he'd be gloating about how Trump was going to ruin life for libs like me and give him back *his* country.
______________
He was a vulnerable guy, an underemployed veteran with some PTSD and alcoholism. He got scammed by two for-profit schools who stole all his GI benefits and gave him nothing. I tried my best to warn him both times, but he was too proud to take advice. He enrolled in ITT less than six months before they closed. They had convinced him that he could be a computer scientist making $100k in two years with zero experience. They called him a loser for not having a degree. I think it was a serious sore spot because he always insult my college experience accusing me of thinking I was smarter than him, and telling me that I was brainwashed. He lived three miles from a community college with a guaranteed transfer program to an excellent state school, but the ITT recruiters convinced him that community college was for losers and dropouts. 

His job prospects were just as bad. He worked construction and was often paid under-the-table. The bosses convinced him he was saving money not paying taxes, but he'd always get screwed in the end. He got hurt once and had no workman's comp or insurance. They had the gall to fire him for getting hurt and being unable to work, and he lost all his savings caring for the wound. He took a similar job, again getting paid under the table, but when the recession hit and the company folded, he had no verifiable income with which to claim unemployment. He lost all his shit to bank repossession and crashed with me for almost a year. He of course had no retirement savings whatsoever. 

We made a resume together and I mailed it out to 30-40 places, he got 2-3 hits, he rejected them for being too boring or paying too little. That's when some asshole offered him another construction job making ""big bucks"" (under-the-table ) in the deep south and he moved away. The only thing I know about the boss is that he didn't mind my friend driving the company vehicle home until he found out that my friend lived in what he called a ""n-gger neighborhood"" then decided to rescind that privilege because ""n-ggers steal everything that isn't bolted down"" (sounds like a great guy...).

The poor guy was the perfect target for their poison, and he drank it with gusto. He even started espousing incel philosophy (even though he was somewhat successful with women). The weirdest bit was that his grandfather was a Mexican immigrant, and his father faced significant discrimination. The whole family were life-long Democrats, but a few months of propaganda turned him into *that*. 

I hope he's OK... but I also hope he doesn't come around again, unless he can come to his senses. :(

I'm not a health policy expert, but my wife has some pre-existing conditions that aren't entirely common, and so I've gotten to know quite a bit about how it actually affected healthcare, as we've been married since 2013, and the full weight of the ACA's impact on healthcare didn't really hit until... 2015 or 2016, to be honest. 

&gt;However, I do see your point- that anything the government touches, isn't going to work as we are told that it will and there will be large swaths of people caught in limbo, or getting trapped in coverage that they don't want.

That's definitely a concern that I have. Especially with comments about how much it's going to emphasize the ""middle class"" - Because so often (and the ACA is again an unfortunately great example of this), the government decides that the ""middle class"" stops at a certain income level that works well on paper (i.e. 4x the poverty line) but leaves a lot of people in higher cost of living areas, especially with kids, out in the dust. 

One of my bigger concerns for this is with the universal pre-k proposal... Will it truly be universal to where someone making $100k a year as the sole income in a household with 2 kids can take advantage of it? Or if the universal pre-k system is understaffed or not big enough, what then?  Sure, $100k/year sounds like a nice salary, and if you're single it's pretty damn comfortable, especially if you're not near a big city.

There may have been more subtle judgement work earlier in the pandemic when the symptoms were less well known and the tests were harder to run. But lots of times the human doctors got that wrong. I would wager the doctors weren't terribly accurate at making this diagnosis before testing.


&gt; Medicine has progressed an immense amount just in my lifetime, but I think the people that realistically think that computers are going to upsurp good clinical providers any time soon still have a lot they need to research.

I literally work in this field.  I know many many doctors personally and professionally.  I have a very good idea of the nature of their work and the capacities of modern software.  From my assessment, the main issue is not that the software is incapable of doing most of the expert-level decision making.  The problem is with the system itself.  Doctors don't want to use this software, and our procedures for managing patients don't have a workflow that integrates computers well. I believe that this entire system would work better if MDs were less involved in diagnosis and treatment that consists of nothing but writing the right prescription.

I mean...it's both.  No side is innocent (and I really hope you know that, republicans are NOT innocent at all)...but that's not the point.

My question is who you think would be better for that?

If you truly think Trump is a uniter, i don't know what to say....he attacks everyone that he views as an enemy, while Biden reaches across the aisle...but if you see it differently, this is just a fundamental difference of perspective.

&gt;If you have not listened to anything he has done in the last 4 years

I have...I've watched his behavior day after day.  I monitor bias of the things i consume, and i fact check the news I'm seeing to explore issues and make sure i'm not being misled.

Perhaps i'm being hyperbolic when i use absolutist terms, but i've watched him in attack mode for the past 3.5 years, giving no ground, attacking people he perceives as an enemy, childish nicknames, saying that the people who showed up to a racist rally were ""fine people""\*, painting all protesters as violent, refusing to even acknowledge that racism is an issue.

&gt;It literally spoke towards the comment, was open hearted, explained my position, said racism was bad - but *because I am for Trump,* nothing else mattered.

I think there are two groups downvoting you.  Certainly some are downvoting because you're for Trump, but others in this thread are getting upvoted even while they say they'll vote for Trump, so it can't just be that.

I think you have a viewpoint that is pretty niche and pretty out of step with what most people see, even those that support him.  I'm not trying to convince you otherwise, but as someone that consumes pretty moderate news and is very aware of bias...even I have no idea how you can see him as a uniter.

You're right that we all want the same things, but...i cannot for the life of me understand your perspective.  If we have the same facts in front of us, you've arrived at a logical conclusion that I cannot reach.

Still, i wish you well and appreciate your engagement here.
